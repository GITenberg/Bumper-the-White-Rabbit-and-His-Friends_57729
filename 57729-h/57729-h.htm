TWILIGHT ANIMAL STORIES<br />

<small><span class="smcap">By the Author</span></small></h2></div>


<p>All little boys and girls who love animals
should become acquainted with Bumper the
white rabbit, with Bobby Gray Squirrel,
with Buster the Bear, and with White Tail
the deer, for they are all a jolly lot, brave and
fearless in danger, and so lovable that you
won&#8217;t lay down any one of the books without
saying wistfully, &#8220;I almost wish I had them
really and truly as friends and not just storybook
acquaintances.&#8221; That, of course, is a
splendid wish; but none of us could afford to
have a big menagerie of wild animals, and
that&#8217;s just what you would have to do if you
went outside of the books. Bumper had many
friends, such as Mr. Blind Rabbit, Fuzzy Wuzz
and Goggle Eyes, his country cousins; and
Bobby Gray Squirrel had his near cousins,
Stripe the chipmunk and Webb the flying
squirrel; while Buster and White Tail were
favored with an endless number of friends and
relatives. If we turned them all loose from the
books, and put them in a ten-acre lot&mdash;but
no, ten acres wouldn&#8217;t be big enough to
accommodate them, perhaps not a hundred
acres.</p>

<p>So we will leave them just where they are&mdash;in
the books&mdash;and read about them, and
let our imaginations take us to them where we
can see them playing, skipping, singing, and
sometimes fighting, and if we read very carefully,
and <i>think</i> as we go along, we may come
to know them even better than if we went out
hunting for them.</p>

<p>Another thing we should remember. By
leaving them in the books, hundreds and
thousands of other boys and girls can enjoy
them, too, sharing with us the pleasures of
the imagination, which after all is one of the
greatest things in the world. In gathering
them together in a real menagerie, we would be
selfish both to Bumper, Bobby, Buster, White
Tail and their friends as well as to thousands
of other little readers who could not share
them with us. So these books of Twilight
Animal Stories are dedicated to all little boys
and girls who love wild animals. All others
are forbidden to read them! They wouldn&#8217;t
understand them if they did.</p>

<p>So come out into the woods with me, and
let us listen and watch, and I promise you it
will be worth while.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Bumper and Sleepy the Opossum</span></small></h2></div>


<p>Bumper, after working hard to trick his
enemies so they would be more afraid of the
rabbits in the woods, had decided the ways of
peace were better than those of war. Not that
he was going to permit Sneaky the Wolf or
Loup the Lynx to pounce upon his people and
eat them up without fighting, but instead of
going around with a chip on his shoulder, expecting
and looking for trouble, he intended
to make friends of all the animals and birds,
and be helpful to them.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how much good to others we
can overlook if we go about with our eyes
shut. There is plenty to do if we look for it.
So Bumper found in a short time that he had
missed a good deal in always looking for the
worst in others instead of for the best.</p>

<p>Only a few days after his change of plans,
which was told of in a former book, Bumper
stumbled upon Sleepy the Opossum in a tree,
with his eyes closed in slumber. At first he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
was going to pass him without a word of greeting,
for Sleepy had more than once angered
him by his sharp tongue. Then he thought
better of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Sleepy!&#8221; he called good-naturedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello yourself!&#8221; was the sullen retort.
&#8220;What do you want to wake me up for! Go
on about your business, and let me sleep!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper was a little nettled at this sharp retort,
and was going to answer back in a huff;
but he didn&#8217;t. He remembered his new resolution.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were you, Sleepy,&#8221; he said instead, &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t sleep outdoors in plain sight like
that. You know Loup the Lynx is hunting in
these woods now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sleepy opened both eyes an instant, and then
closed them again. &#8220;You can&#8217;t scare me,&#8221; he
drawled. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard how you&#8217;ve been stirring
up trouble in the woods. Now don&#8217;t
come around here with any of your tales.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper was more nettled than ever at this
reply, but still he controlled himself. &#8220;You&#8217;d
better listen to me, Sleepy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
true that Loup the Lynx is hunting in these
woods, and if he passed here he could see you
easily. Why not find a good hiding place if
you must sleep outdoors?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>&#8220;Because I prefer this warm place in the
sun. Now go on and leave me alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Bumper hopped along, feeling that his
offer of kindness was not wanted. He hopped
for some distance until suddenly he heard a
noise in the tree overhead. He stopped and
glanced up.</p>

<p>There was Loup the Lynx crouched in the
tree, looking for some small animal he could
pounce upon. Bumper was concealed from
view by the bushes, and unless Loup saw him
he was safe. It would be an easy matter to
hide there until Loup passed on.</p>

<p>But as he crouched he thought of Sleepy a
short distance away. If Loup hunted in his
direction he would surely see him, and that
would be the last of Sleepy. Now the desire
to hide, and save his own skin, made him
crouch still lower in the bushes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s none of my affair,&#8221; he said to himself.
&#8220;I warned Sleepy, and he wouldn&#8217;t listen to
me. I don&#8217;t need to do anything more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course, Bumper was right in a way, and
he couldn&#8217;t be blamed for thinking of his own
skin first; but all the time his conscience kept
troubling him. What if Loup should spring
upon Sleepy and kill him! How would he
feel! He would never feel that he had done
all of his duty.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said finally, &#8220;I can&#8217;t hide here and
let Sleepy be caught. I must warn him once
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having made this decision, he crept out of
his hiding place, and keeping the trees and
bushes between him and the Loup, he made
his way slowly back to where Sleepy was sunning
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sleepy,&#8221; he called softly when he got under
the tree. &#8220;Sleepy, wake up!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sleepy the Opossum opened his eyes again,
and seeing who it was calling him they
snapped with anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d mind your business,
Bumper!&#8221; he said in a loud, disagreeable
voice. &#8220;If you wake me up again I&#8217;ll come
down and bite you. Now get out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Sleepy, you must hide. Loup the
Lynx is coming. I saw him only a short distance
away, and he&#8217;s coming in this direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t you run and hide? Loup
is as fond of rabbits as of opossums. If he
was coming you&#8217;d be the first one to run and
hide. No, you can&#8217;t make me believe any
such story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But on my word of honor, Sleepy, he&#8217;s
coming,&#8221; protested Bumper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him come then! Now I&#8217;m&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>Sleepy didn&#8217;t finish his sentence. There
was a snap of a twig nearby, and Bumper
whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Run! Run! He&#8217;s here! If you wait another
minute you&#8217;re lost!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sleepy was suddenly wide awake. He was
suspicious of that snapping twig. He started
down the tree for his hole where he would be
safe. Half way there he caught sight of a
pair of yellow eyes watching him. Then
with a scream Loup the Lynx sprang for him,
covering the distance between the two trees
in one mighty jump. He landed plump on
the limb where Sleepy had been sleeping.</p>

<p>But Bumper&#8217;s timely warning had been of
use. Sleepy was on the next limb, and before
Loup could spring again the Opossum
slipped into his hole with a squeak of fear.
Loup sprang at him with a snarl of rage and
anger, for he had missed him by merely an
inch.</p>

<p>During all this time, Bumper had looked
around for his own safety. Loup had not
spied him, and he kept well under the green
leaves of the bushes. Then just as Loup made
the final spring for Sleepy, the white rabbit
slipped under a big log where he could not be
seen.</p>

<p>He lay there panting and palpitating with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
fear. Would Loup come sniffing around and
discover him? Or would he finally leave the
place to hunt elsewhere? It was a terrible
moment of uncertainty.</p>

<p>But luck was with him. Loup, never suspecting
the presence of a rabbit below, finally
leaped to a higher branch of the tree, and
looked around. This was his favorite method
of spying out any helpless animal below.
Then he jumped to the next tree, and so made
his way to another part of the woods.</p>

<p>Bumper waited a long time before he crept
from his hiding place to renew his trip. When
he finally did so all was quiet in the woods.
But just as he hopped away a voice from the
hole in the tree called to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You saved my life, Bumper,&#8221; Sleepy said,
peeking his head out. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I spoke so
crossly to you. Won&#8217;t you forgive me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Sleepy,&#8221; replied Bumper. &#8220;And
I&#8217;m mighty glad Loup wasn&#8217;t a minute sooner.
Good-bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hopping away this time, he felt much better
than before. He had done a good service
to Sleepy, and won his friendship for all time.
Next he had a chance to help Browny the
Muskrat in a very peculiar way, which will
be the subject of the following story.</p>

<hr class="chap" />






<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">STORY II<br />

<small><span class="smcap">Browny the Muskrat</span></small></h2></div>


<p>One day Browny the Muskrat had burrowed
so deep into the ground back of the
river that his tunnel had caved into the rabbit
burrow of Rolly Polly, and if it had not been
for the quick work of Rolly Polly some of his
children would have been drowned. The water
from the river poured in right after
Browny and the burrow was quickly flooded.</p>

<p>Now Rolly Polly had never forgiven
Browny for that accident, the more so because
Browny had laughed at the plight of the rabbits
instead of apologizing. Of course, it was
an accident, but Browny couldn&#8217;t understand
why rabbits objected to a little water. So far
as he was concerned, he preferred to swim
around in underground tunnels filled with
water than crawling through dry ones.</p>

<p>So there had always been ill feeling between
the rabbits and Browny the Muskrat. It was
one of those little quarrels between friends
that lasts a long time, and often ends in
trouble. It was such a senseless quarrel, too!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Browny hadn&#8217;t intended it, and he should
have said so. Rolly Polly may have suspected
it was an accident, but as Browny didn&#8217;t
apologize he was angry, and wouldn&#8217;t speak to
any of the Muskrats again.</p>

<p>Bumper knew of this ancient quarrel, but as
he had been busy with other things he hadn&#8217;t
paid much attention to it. He had never
spoken to Browny or any of his people. It
wasn&#8217;t the proper thing to do, you know.</p>

<p>One day Bumper was eating grass near the
marshy end of the river, where the big cattails
and rushes grow tall and slender, when
he saw Browny sitting on a bog watching him.
He had just emerged from the water, and was
all wet and dripping. Bumper continued eating
grass without paying any attention to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing here, Bumper?&#8221;
Browny called to him after a while. &#8220;This
isn&#8217;t your feeding ground. This marsh belongs
to my family.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper stopped nibbling and looked at
Browny in astonishment. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that
the marsh belonged to any one in particular,&#8221;
he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it does, and now you know it,&#8221; answered
Browny in an unfriendly voice. &#8220;Now
get out of here!&#8221;</p>

<p>The tone of the voice as much as the command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
irritated Bumper, and a sharp reply
sprang to his lips; but he checked it. He
wasn&#8217;t going to offend by angry words.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Browny, if you say so, I&#8217;ll go,&#8221;
he answered. Then, as an after thought, he
added very politely: &#8220;And I&#8217;m sorry if I&#8217;ve
trespassed upon your place. I won&#8217;t do it
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Browny was so surprised by this apology
that he sat there a moment in silence and stared
at the White Rabbit. Never before had a rabbit
apologized to him. Indeed, whenever
words passed between them, they were harsh
and unfriendly. Then, instead of accepting
the apology in a friendly spirit, he laughed,
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Ho! You&#8217;re getting very polite all of
a sudden, Bumper! Well, you can&#8217;t make
friends with me that way. I don&#8217;t take any
stock in soft words. Actions count with me
more than polite words. No, I don&#8217;t think you
will do it again. If you do you know what
will happen to you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper withdrew before the angry retort
that rose to his lips could escape. He was very
indignant. Browny was an ungrateful fellow.
Well, he&#8217;d have nothing more to do with him
or any of his tribe. Some day he might find a
chance to get even with him. No, that would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
never do! He had decided to make friends
and not enemies. He would forget it, but&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly he hopped about a foot in the
air, so quickly that his sentence was never finished.
What was it in the marshy ground at
his feet? He had touched something hard
and cold that jangled when he tripped
against it. For a moment he stood ready to
fly, but on second thought he decided he would
investigate, for the thing, whatever it was,
hadn&#8217;t moved. It still lay coiled up in the
grass.</p>

<p>Bumper approached it carefully and smelt
of it, and then laughed at his fright. It was a
long chain, which for a moment had seemed
to him like Killer the Snake coiled up in the
grass. One end was fastened to a stake, and
the other&mdash;</p>

<p>Horror of Horrors! It was attached to a
trap, a steel spring trap, concealed right in
the mouth of Browny&#8217;s hole. Some one had set
the trap there to catch Browny or one of his
family. Forgetting all his anger, Bumper ran
back, and shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Browny! Browny!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ve found
something!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, leave it where it is,&#8221; replied Browny,
stroking his whiskers. &#8220;Findings aren&#8217;t keepings
around here.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>&#8220;But it&#8217;s a trap, Browny,&#8221; added Bumper.
&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d want to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, traps don&#8217;t bother me. The Hunters
have been setting them for me as long as I can
remember. But I&#8217;m too shrewd for them.
They can&#8217;t catch me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this one is&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, go on!&#8221; Browny interrupted. &#8220;I ordered
you off my place once. Must I do it
again?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper made no reply. He had done all
that he could in warning Browny of the danger.
Now the risk was his. He wouldn&#8217;t put
himself out again to help a Muskrat.</p>

<p>But once again that little conscience of his
bothered him. After he had hopped away in
the woods, he stopped to nibble at some young
buds. &#8220;What if Browny was caught in the
steel trap?&#8221; he asked himself. &#8220;It would be
terrible! He would either starve to death or
be killed. Oh, I wish he&#8217;d listened to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>But he kept right on eating. It wasn&#8217;t any
of his concern. But curiously enough he ate
toward the marsh, and not away from it, until
once more he stood on the very edge. He
seemed surprised at this, but after all he knew
all the time he was eating toward it.</p>

<p>He looked around. Browny was no longer
in sight. Perhaps he had gone into the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
again. Bumper sat there and listened, with
his neck stretched up to look over the tall
grasses.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a muffled squeaking reached
his ears. Where did it come from, and who
was making it? He looked all around him in
vain, and then he thought of the trap.</p>

<p>He hopped through the reeds and rushes
until he came to it. Yes, there was the long
chain, and the stake, but there was something
at the other end, for the chain kept twitching
and pulling. And out of Browny&#8217;s hole came
a faint, muffled cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help! Help! Oh, won&#8217;t somebody help
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Browny?&#8221; Bumper
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;My tail&#8217;s caught in the trap, and I can&#8217;t get
out or in. I&#8217;m held fast in the hole. Oh, I&#8217;ll
die here if somebody doesn&#8217;t help me before
the Hunters come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute!&#8221; shouted Bumper. &#8220;I think
I can get you out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seizing the chain with his teeth, he threw
himself back on his haunches, and began pulling
with all his might. It was a mighty tug of
war, for besides pulling the chain and steel
trap out of the hole he had to pull Browny,
too. He pulled and pulled, slipping in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
mud, and getting all covered with it until he
was no longer white. But the chain was coming,
and so was the trap.</p>

<p>Suddenly it popped out, and right after it
came Browny. The teeth of the trap had
caught the tip of his tail. With the last jerk
this slipped out of the trap, and Browny was
free. He switched his long tail, and looked at
it, but as he hadn&#8217;t lost any of it he was greatly
relieved. Then he turned to the rabbit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bumper,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that was a fine thing to
do after the way I insulted you. If you can
forgive me I&#8217;m always going to be your
friend. You really saved my life, for the
Hunters will soon be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Browny,&#8221; was the reply.
&#8220;I want to be your friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the next story you will hear of how
Bumper made friends with Billy the Mink.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STORY III<br />

<small><span class="smcap">Billy the Mink</span></small></h2></div>


<p>Billy the Mink was a cousin to Gray Back
the Weasel, but being much larger and more
ferocious when attacked he was more to be
feared. In addition to this he could swim like
a duck and dive like a stone. In fact, he preferred
the water to the dry land, and was very
proud of his fur coat. Sometimes he would
sit on the bank of the river in the sun just to
admire the beautiful, glossy fur that nature
had given him. With the sun sparkling on it
when wet or dry, it certainly was something
to admire and envy.</p>

<p>Billy the Mink, unlike his namesake Billy
the Porcupine, had the bad habit of sometimes
raiding rabbit burrows for food, and if there
were young bunnies in the nest he made away
with some of them in spite of the protests of
their fond parents. This habit had caused him
to be feared and hated by the rabbits, which
was a very natural thing.</p>

<p>Roaming through the woods one day
shortly after his adventure with Browny the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Muskrat, Bumper discovered Billy the Mink
sunning himself near his home. He really
didn&#8217;t want anything to do with Billy on account
of his bad habits, and he was going to
pass him without a word; but Billy caught
sight of Bumper, and was suddenly envious
of the beautiful fur of the white rabbit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw a white rabbit before,&#8221; he
hailed. &#8220;Come nearer and let me see your
beautiful fur.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper wished to be polite and hopped
closer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It really is white,&#8221; Billy added, admiring
the fur. &#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re mighty proud of
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very fond of it, and glad I have it,&#8221;
replied Bumper modestly. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; honestly,
&#8220;I&#8217;m proud of it. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any
harm in saying that. We have a right to be
proud of the dress nature gave us&mdash;a little
proud, I mean, but not too much as some people
are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy sneered, for he took this as a hint at
his own well-known pride. &#8220;I suppose you
mean by that I&#8217;m too proud,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t thinking of any one in particular,&#8221;
replied Bumper. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be so impolite
as that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you wouldn&#8217;t! You&#8217;re very modest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and good today. Well, I know you referred
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper wished to end the conversation, and
started to hop away, but Billy suddenly
jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so proud of your white coat that
I&#8217;m going to soil it for you,&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Before Bumper realized what he intended
to do, Billy began pelting him with mud,
which he dug up with his hind legs. It spattered
all over Bumper, and some of it went in
his eyes so that he couldn&#8217;t see which way to
run. This was great fun to Billy, and he set
up a shout of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re as spotted as Mr. Turtle and
nearly as black. Ho! Ho! What a sight!&#8221;</p>

<p>Even this humiliation of Bumper didn&#8217;t
satisfy him. He wanted to roll him in the
mud, and quick as a wink he leaped for him
and caught him by the back. Then before
Bumper could run away he had him down in
the soft mud, which clung to him and turned
his beautiful white fur a nasty brown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now look at yourself!&#8221; laughed Billy.
&#8220;You&#8217;re about as homely looking as any rabbit
in the woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy had returned to the place where he
had been sunning himself, and flung himself
down to rest and laugh. Bumper stood twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
feet away spattered from head to foot with the
mud. He was so upset by this unwarranted
attack and humiliation that for a moment he
could not speak. His one desire was to get
even with Billy, and punish him.</p>

<p>Then as if in answer to his wish there came
the opportunity. Gliding out of the bushes
with stealthy tread, approaching Billy from
behind was Sneaky the Wolf. In their
struggle neither one had noticed his approach.
He had crept almost upon them before
Bumper happened to see him.</p>

<p>Sneaky was after Billy the Mink, for he was
much the nearest, and was larger and fatter
than Bumper. He offered such a tempting
dinner that Sneaky was all atremble, crouching
for the spring.</p>

<p>Bumper was perfectly safe for two reasons.
One was that Sneaky was thinking only of
Billy and ignoring Bumper, and another was
the distance was too great for Sneaky to reach
the white rabbit in a single bound. It seemed
like a just punishment for his rough joke in
spattering Bumper with the mud. In another
minute Sneaky would have him in his jaws,
and Billy would never play another joke or
raid a rabbit&#8217;s burrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;He who laughs last laughs the longest,&#8221;
Bumper said to himself, smiling.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>Then there came a sudden change over him.
He seemed to see Billy all torn and bloody,
and heard his pitiful squeals as Sneaky killed
him. Oh, that was too severe a punishment
for playing a rough joke! No, he couldn&#8217;t
stand by in silence and see Billy killed even
to satisfy a desire for revenge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy!&#8221; he called suddenly. &#8220;Billy, dive
in the water! Don&#8217;t look around! Sneaky&#8217;s
behind you! Dive! Dive!&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy had a horror of Sneaky the Wolf, and
the very mention of his name sent the shivers
through him. He didn&#8217;t wait to ask questions,
not even to turn and look. He took a
flying dive for the water just as Sneaky leaped
for him.</p>

<p>Billy plunged into the water not a second
too soon. It had hardly closed over him before
Sneaky was there, snapping and snarling.
Then finding that his victim had escaped
him, for Sneaky was no diver or swimmer,
he turned angrily upon Bumper to punish
him for giving the warning.</p>

<p>But Bumper had taken advantage of the interval
to escape. When Sneaky sprang to
where he had been standing there was no rabbit
in sight. Doubly angry at finding both of
his victims gone, Sneaky snarled and snapped
his teeth, trotting up and down the edge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
river, watching for the return of Billy or
Bumper.</p>

<p>But they were wise enough to remain out of
sight. Sneaky waited a long time, and then
hid in the bushes and waited longer. But
nothing happened. Then disgusted, and still
very angry, he finally trotted away in the
woods.</p>

<p>He hadn&#8217;t been gone long before a head
popped out of a hole, and Bumper, with the
mud all dried and caked on his fur, crawled
out. He watched and listened to make sure
he was alone, and then hopped to the bank of
the stream.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;how will I ever get
this mud off of me? It&#8217;s all dried on!&#8221;</p>

<p>As if in response to his words, a nose appeared
out of the water, and Billy the Mink
swam ashore. Bumper eyed him suspiciously
at first, and stood ready to run; but Billy
spoke to relieve his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go, Bumper!&#8221; he called. &#8220;Wait a
minute!&#8221;</p>

<p>Swimming quickly ashore, Billy climbed up
on the embankment. &#8220;That was a narrow
squeak for me,&#8221; he added, panting a little from
his exertions. &#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t been for you,
Sneaky would surely have had me. Why did
you warn me after I&#8217;d treated you so?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>&#8220;Because,&#8221; stammered Bumper, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
want to see you killed, Billy, even if you had
spattered me with mud. But how am I ever
going to get clean again? This mud is all
caked on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll clean you, Bumper. It&#8217;s the least I can
do to repay you. Now stand by the river
while I splash water over you. That will soon
wash the mud off.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a strange sight, Billy the Mink cleaning
Bumper the White Rabbit by the edge of
the river, each laughing and enjoying the work
as if it was a new game, and if any one had
seen them it would have caused no end of surprise.
They were now as close friends as before
they were enemies.</p>

<p>And if Bumper gets clean in time, and Billy
doesn&#8217;t spatter more mud on him, you will
hear in the next story of how Bumper met Mr.
Beaver.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STORY IV<br />

<small><span class="smcap">Mr. Beaver Has a Surprise</span></small></h2></div>


<p>Mr. Beaver was the most exclusive animal
of the North Woods. He not only lived apart
from the other animals, but he constructed a
house which no others could get into. Often
it was merely an island in the middle of the
stream, which he built up himself, and no animals
except perhaps Billy the Mink or
Browny the Muskrat could even reach.</p>

<p>But Billy and Browny had no desire to
reach it or to investigate it. Mr. Beaver was
as cross as he was fierce and dangerous. He
had long teeth, which he kept as sharp as a
razor by cutting down trees with them. Teeth
that could cut down a big oak or chestnut were
certainly to be feared.</p>

<p>Living alone had made Mr. Beaver a good
deal of an old cross-patch. Most people who
live that way generally do get cross and irritable
in time. Sometimes if another animal
ran across Mr. Beaver&#8217;s house-top he would
jump out and make a great time about it.</p>

<p>Mr. Beaver had constructed a dam across a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
branch of the river so the water above it had
backed up and formed a big pond. Thus he
could have his own private fishing pond, for
the fish upstream couldn&#8217;t go down any further,
and once caught in the pond Mr. Beaver
killed a few whenever he was hungry.</p>

<p>Naturally he was very careful about this
dam, and didn&#8217;t want any one crossing it or
interfering with it. If it was broken in one
place the water would rush through it and let
out many of his fish.</p>

<p>One day, after a long roundabout trip
through the woods, Bumper was returning
home when he reached the river. The bridge
made of fallen trees that crossed to the other
side was nearly a mile below him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear,&#8221; he groaned, &#8220;I&#8217;m dead tired,
and now I must walk a mile down the river to
get home.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood on the brink of the stream looking
longingly at the other side. Then, glancing
up, his eyes opened with surprise and pleasure.
There was Mr. Beaver&#8217;s dam a few
yards above him, stretching from bank to
bank.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose Mr. Beaver will object,&#8221; he said
to himself, &#8220;but if I walk very softly he won&#8217;t
hear me. Certainly not if he&#8217;s asleep. Anyway,
I&#8217;m going across that dam.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>You couldn&#8217;t blame him for wanting to save
that long tramp down the river and back, and
nobody but Mr. Beaver would have objected
to his crossing the dam. Bumper hoped that
by hopping along gently he wouldn&#8217;t attract
Mr. Beaver&#8217;s attention. But it is very difficult
to walk across the roof of a house and not
attract the attention of those living in it.</p>

<p>No sooner had Bumper got fairly well on
the top of the dam, than there was an angry
growl inside. Then almost before he could
think, up came Mr. Beaver, snorting and
spouting water from his nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing on my dam?&#8221; he demanded.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know that nobody is allowed
to cross it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Mr. Beaver,&#8221; replied Bumper.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been a long distance today, and when I
reached the river I felt too tired to go down
by the bridge. I thought if I stepped very
softly it wouldn&#8217;t disturb you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it did! Now go back and take the
bridge, and don&#8217;t you ever dare cross this dam
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the bridge is a mile down stream,&#8221; replied
Bumper, &#8220;and I&#8217;m half way across the
dam. Surely you&#8217;ll let me go on now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you can&#8217;t go another step.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Beaver stood directly in his way so he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
could not cross without passing close to him.
Mr. Beaver&#8217;s refusal angered Bumper for a
moment, and instead of turning around to obey
he decided he&#8217;d trick Mr. Beaver. He could
easily leap over his head and run away from
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not very friendly to make me do
that,&#8221; Bumper replied, still watching for his
chance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t intend to be friendly,&#8221; was the
prompt retort. &#8220;I only want to be let alone.
Now go back!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, Mr. Beaver,&#8221; Bumper replied,
&#8220;I could get by you very easily and cross
the dam? I could jump over your head in one
hop and almost reach the other shore. But I
won&#8217;t do it! If you&#8217;re so mean as to send me
back, I don&#8217;t want anything more to do with
you. The sooner I get away the better I&#8217;ll like
it. But some day, Mr. Beaver, your selfishness
will bring you trouble. You will wish for a
friend then, and none will come. No, not
one!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t frighten me!&#8221; exclaimed Mr.
Beaver. &#8220;Nothing&#8217;s going to happen to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>But even as he said it he felt a little nervous.
Bumper&#8217;s words had touched the quick. He
wished now he hadn&#8217;t been so selfish, but he
was too old and crusty to acknowledge it. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
he stood on guard and watched the white rabbit
hop back to the shore, and then he swung
around to take a long dive into the water.</p>

<p>Perhaps Mr. Beaver had been on that log
a hundred times, and nothing had ever happened;
but one end had been balanced on another
log for so long that it was rotted away.
Suddenly it slipped down and carried Mr.
Beaver with it, but not on top. He was
wedged in between two logs so that he
couldn&#8217;t move down or up. Squeeze his body
as flat as he could there was no way out.</p>

<p>For a moment he struggled frantically, and
then finding he could make no headway he
became frightened. What if he were caught
there and couldn&#8217;t escape! He would starve
to death in a few days, and no one would
know anything about it until too late.</p>

<p>What a horrible prospect! With a little
squeal of fear at the thought of it, he looked
up at the sky and across the pond he had
made. There was no one to help him. Now
he recalled Bumper&#8217;s words. When he
needed a friend there would be none to come
to help him. Oh, how much he would give
for a friend just now!</p>

<p>He struggled and struggled, but the two
logs were embedded in the mud so he couldn&#8217;t
budge them. He was caught so he couldn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
get at them with his sharp teeth to gnaw his
way out. He was certainly a prisoner for
life.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a tap, tap over his head,
and he looked up to see the White Rabbit
gazing down at him. &#8220;I heard you squeal,
Mr. Beaver,&#8221; Bumper said, &#8220;and I thought
something had happened to you. Oh, I see
you&#8217;re caught between the two logs!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Bumper, and I can&#8217;t get out. I&#8217;m
afraid I&#8217;ll starve here unless you can find
Buster the Bear and get him to move the logs.
And even then he may eat me up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can do better than that,&#8221; said Bumper.
&#8220;If you keep still I can gnaw away enough
from this log so you can squeeze your way
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if you could, Bumper!&#8221; exclaimed
Mr. Beaver.</p>

<p>There were tears in Mr. Beaver&#8217;s eyes, for
he was terribly frightened, and when Bumper
began gnawing at the log he watched him
anxiously.</p>

<p>It was a long, hard job, but Bumper finally
gnawed away enough of the wood for Mr.
Beaver to get out. When he finally stood on
the top of the log, he was so shaken by the
experience that his teeth chattered.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i036.jpg" alt="Tell your people that they can cross my dam" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Tell your people that they can cross my dam</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bumper, you were right,&#8221; he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
&#8220;Everybody needs friends, and the time to
make them is before you&#8217;re in danger. I
won&#8217;t be so selfish again. Tell your people
that they can cross my dam, and when they
come ask them to speak a friendly word to
me. I want to be their friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>All of which delighted Bumper, and when
he finally left Mr. Beaver his heart was singing
for gladness.</p>

<p>In the next story there will be an account
of how the Birds brought terrible news to the
rabbits.</p>

<p>After leaving Mr. Beaver, Bumper hurried
home, and when he hopped into the burrow
he was greeted by Fuzzy Wuzz who had been
anxiously waiting for him. Bumper had been
away from home so much lately that he was
as glad to get back as Fuzzy Wuzz was to see
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve all missed you so much,&#8221; she said
tenderly. &#8220;Old Blind Rabbit&#8217;s been asking
about you every hour of the day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I have good news to tell you,&#8221; was
the reply. Then he related his experience
with Mr. Beaver and with Billy the Mink,
concluding with the remark: &#8220;They&#8217;re both
our friends now. In time of need they&#8217;d stand
by us and help us. That&#8217;s something worth
bragging about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, it is, Bumper,&#8221; replied Old Blind
Rabbit. &#8220;It is better to make a dozen friends
than one enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper was very much pleased with his
work, and highly gratified at Old Blind Rabbit&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
commendation of it. Now that he had
set forth to make friends of all the birds and
animals of the woods who would listen to
him, he felt that he must leave no stone unturned
to accomplish his end.</p>

<p>So after resting a while in the burrow, he
got up to go forth once more to see if further
adventures that he could turn to good account
awaited him. &#8220;It&#8217;s astonishing,&#8221; he remarked
to Fuzzy Wuzz, &#8220;how much good
you can do in the world if you&#8217;re on the lookout
for it. I&#8217;m just learning to keep my eyes
open.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fuzzy Wuzz nodded and smiled at him.
They were standing at the entrance to the burrow
when suddenly Hermit the Thrush, who
had been singing a sweet melody in the bushes,
stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go, on, Hermit, and finish the song,&#8221;
Bumper called. &#8220;I like to hear such a jolly,
blithe fellow sing.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Hermit flitted his wings and cocked
his head sideways. &#8220;For some reason I don&#8217;t
feel like singing, Bumper,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
explain it, but I&#8217;ve simply lost my voice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper laughed good-naturedly. &#8220;That&#8217;s
funny,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;A moment ago you were
singing so sweetly that I could hardly think
for listening to you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, I know, but I can&#8217;t any more. Do you
ever have a feeling that something&#8217;s going to
happen? You can&#8217;t tell just what it is or
when it&#8217;s coming, but you know it&#8217;s in the air.
Well, that&#8217;s the way I felt all of a sudden, and
my voice left me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t give away to such feelings,
Hermit,&#8221; laughed Bumper. &#8220;You know
there&#8217;s nothing in such&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Before he could finish, Black Cap the
Chickadee flitted down from a high branch,
and exclaimed breathlessly: &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter!
Something&#8217;s going to happen! I feel
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Hermit gravely, &#8220;I was just
telling Bumper I felt it, but he laughed at
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, if two of you have the same
feeling,&#8221; added Bumper more gravely, &#8220;maybe
there is something in the air that disturbs
you. Perhaps we&#8217;re going to have a storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t a storm,&#8221; said Black Cap,
shaking his head. &#8220;I know that feeling, and
this is different.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more there was a flutter of wings
among the branches, and Yellow Breast the
Chat dropped down to the side of Hermit and
Black Cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all in a flutter,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
it out. Something&#8217;s wrong. I just know it.
I feel it in my bones. I just had to come down
here for company until the strange feeling
goes away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now,&#8221; exclaimed Bumper, sitting
back on his haunches, &#8220;this is getting interesting,
and also quite serious. When all three
of you have that strange feeling, I must confess
there must be something in it. Now how
do you feel, Yellow Breast? Can&#8217;t you describe
the feeling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s nothing I can put in words,&#8221; the
Chat answered hesitatingly. &#8220;It&#8217;s just a restless
feeling that makes me nervous. I feel all
the time as if there was danger brooding in
the air.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s all your imagination?&#8221;
asked Bumper. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t let it
bother me any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fact was the three birds sitting on the
limb were a little ashamed of their nameless
fear, and Bumper&#8217;s remarks added to their
confusion. Still they could not deny, it was
quite a coincidence that all three should have
experienced the same strange feeling.</p>

<p>Fuzzy Wuzz was more in sympathy with
them than Bumper, for she sometimes had attacks
of the nerves which made her afraid
of everything, even of her own shadow.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>&#8220;I think, Bumper,&#8221; she interrupted, &#8220;that
there&#8217;s something in the air that upsets them.
Don&#8217;t you smell something queer?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Bumper sniffed the air, holding
his nose far up and trying hard to distinguish
any unusual odor or fragrance in it.
&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t say that I do,&#8221; he replied slowly
after a while. &#8220;Yes, maybe there is a little
peculiar odor, but not enough to account for
all this disturbance.&#8221;</p>

<p>From out of the leaves almost at their feet
Mrs. Oven-Bird, who had been sitting on her
nest, crept forth, and overhearing the remarks
sniffed the air, and then exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the looks of the sun. See how
red it is. Now what does that mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sun is always red, but sometimes more
so than at others,&#8221; replied Bumper. &#8220;Yes, it
is very red, but I&#8217;ve seen it that way at sunset.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this isn&#8217;t sunset,&#8221; replied Yellow
Breast the Chat a little impatiently. &#8220;It&#8217;s
early in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a startled whirring of wings in
the bushes, and every one ducked his head
ready for flight, fearing that it might be
Dasher the Hawk or even Baldy the Eagle;
but it was only Whip-Poor-Will the Night
hawk. He was so unused to flying around in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the day time that he was half blinded, and
nearly collided with the Chat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, me!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;What&#8217;s going to happen!
I can&#8217;t set on my nest! Tell me the
worst! I can&#8217;t see to fly around. The sun
hurts my eyes. But I must know what it is.
I know it&#8217;s something terrible!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know of anything, Whip-Poor-Will,&#8221;
said Bumper. &#8220;We were just discussing
it when you interrupted. The sun is
very red, but not redder than I&#8217;ve seen it before,
and Fuzzy Wuzz says she smells something
unusual in the air; but beyond that we
know no more than you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then go and find out,&#8221; said Poor Will impatiently.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t go back to my nest in peace
until I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But who can tell us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; exclaimed Chat suddenly.
&#8220;What&#8217;s that noise?&#8221;</p>

<p>And from sheer nervousness Yellow Breast
the Chat crouched lower on the branch and
shivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; laughed Bumper, &#8220;that&#8217;s nothing
but Rusty the Blackbird calling! He&#8217;s always
noisy and chattering. Listen to him!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Rusty was much noisier than usual.
He was so excited that his voice was raised to
a high pitch. He was calling to the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
birds and making a great commotion. When
he finally dropped down in front of the burrow
he was all out of breath. It took him
some time to tell his tale.</p>

<p>&#8220;The woods are on fire,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and it&#8217;s
coming this way. I was up on Bald Mountain
when it broke out, and I flew as fast as I could
to warn everybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bald Mountain!&#8221; exclaimed Bumper.
&#8220;Why, Rusty, that&#8217;s miles and miles away
from here. That isn&#8217;t anything to get excited
about. I&#8217;m surprised that you should get
frightened.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Rusty liked to carry important news,
especially exciting news, and he had felt very
big in being the first to tell of the fire; but
Bumper&#8217;s words made him think that he had
exaggerated it, and he felt quite crest-fallen.
However, in the next story you will read of
how the fire spread and raced down Bald
Mountain.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STORY VI<br />

<small><span class="smcap">The Fire in the Woods</span></small></h2></div>


<p>Bumper felt that he had performed a real
act of kindness in quieting the fright of the
birds, especially of Rusty the Blackbird,
whose excitement was likely to stir up general
fear throughout the woods. Of course, a fire
in the woods would be a dreadful thing. They
couldn&#8217;t think of anything worse. But it was
unwise to give a false alarm and scare all the
young ones.</p>

<p>At the same time Bumper felt a little uneasy.
Bald Mountain was a long way off, but
the wind was blowing straight from it, and he
began to think that perhaps this accounted for
the uneasiness of Hermit, Black Cap, Mrs.
Oven-Bird and Whip-Poor-Will. Fuzzy
Wuzz might have sniffed the odor of smoke
on the air, and the frightened birds had
sensed the danger in the same way. Also it
would account for the blood-red sun.</p>

<p>But Bumper continued to make light of the
danger, laughing good-naturedly, and saying
that Rusty must have had his wings singed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
flying so fast through the air. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t
worry about it,&#8221; he said finally, as he hopped
away. &#8220;Now go back to your nest Whip-Poor-Will,
and you, too, Mrs. Oven-Bird. If
anything happens we&#8217;ll give the alarm.&#8221;</p>

<p>The birds, now they knew what had caused
their restlessness, and being assured by
Bumper that timely warning would be given
if the fire spread, breathed easier and soon forgot
all about it. But not Bumper. He was
anxious to find out for himself if the fire was
coming toward them.</p>

<p>As soon as he could get away from Fuzzy
Wuzz, he ran as fast as he could in the direction
of Bald Mountain. It was a long run,
but Bumper was feeling fine, and he covered
the ground with great speed.</p>

<p>Half way there he stumbled upon Crawler
the Tortoise, who was trudging along in the
opposite direction. &#8220;Where to now, Crawler?&#8221;
he hailed.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the river,&#8221; replied Crawler without
stopping. &#8220;I smell smoke, and I&#8217;m going to
get in the river mud before it&#8217;s too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fire&#8217;s a long distance away, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
replied Bumper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but it takes me a long time to crawl a
short distance. So I&#8217;m going to start early.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper thought this was a good idea, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
he made no attempt to detain Crawler. If he
couldn&#8217;t travel any faster than the Tortoise, he
would do the same&mdash;start early.</p>

<p>Half a mile further he found Hoppy the
Toad burrowing into the ground. &#8220;What are
you digging for, Hoppy?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;For a safe place when the fire comes,&#8221; was
the reply. &#8220;If I don&#8217;t burrow down a foot or
more I&#8217;ll be roasted alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think the fire&#8217;s coming this way?&#8221;
asked Bumper more alarmed than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it is! Ask Baldy the Eagle up
there! He&#8217;s so excited he can&#8217;t do anything
but circle around and utter loud cries. He can
see what we can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper looked up and saw Baldy the Eagle
and his mate circling around in great spirals.
They were so far from the earth that they
looked like tiny specks, but after a while they
swooped down and lighted on the decayed
stump of a tree.</p>

<p>Ordinarily Bumper wouldn&#8217;t have dared to
speak to Baldy, but fear now had made the
Eagles tame and friendly. A fire in the woods
changes friends and foes alike.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Baldy,&#8221; Bumper called, &#8220;I can&#8217;t see
down here, but you can up there. Tell me if
the fire is coming this way, and is there any
danger?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, Bumper,&#8221; replied Baldy, glancing
down at the white rabbit. &#8220;It has swept clear
across Bald Mountain, and is now racing down
the slope on this side. Our new home is destroyed,
and we&#8217;re fleeing for our lives. If you
want to escape you should run for the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it as bad as all that!&#8221; exclaimed Bumper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come up here and look for yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper smiled at this remark, for he had
no more chance of getting up there in the top
of the tree than he had of swimming like Billy
the Mink under water.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should warn all of your people to
flee,&#8221; Baldy added. &#8220;And there&#8217;s no time to
be lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldy and his mate rose then and flew away,
leaving the white rabbit alone. &#8220;It must be
worse than I thought,&#8221; he said to himself.
&#8220;Baldy doesn&#8217;t get frightened very easily. I
must hurry back home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then a great commotion back of him
made him turn. Out of a big hole in a tree
came Great Horn the Owl.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it!&#8221; he cried. Then seeing the
white rabbit, he added: &#8220;Is it true, Bumper,
the woods are on fire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid they are, Great Horn. Baldy
the Eagle said the fire&#8217;s coming this way
rapidly.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>&#8220;Then I must pack up and leave at once.
But I&#8217;m so blind I can&#8217;t see which way to
fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Follow the wind, Great Horn, and you
won&#8217;t need your eyes. It&#8217;s blowing away from
the fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. I&#8217;ll do it. Thank you for the
kind advice, Bumper. Now I must hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I, too,&#8221; said Bumper.</p>

<p>But once more there was a crash, and
through the bushes sprang White Tail the
Deer. Bumper expected to see Sneaky the
Wolf or Buster the Bear after him, but when
neither appeared he hailed the deer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it the fire you&#8217;re running from, White
Tail?&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, all the woods will be burnt up. You&#8217;d
better run for the river, Bumper. It&#8217;s your
only chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he didn&#8217;t get far before a swarm of birds
swept down upon him. There were Piney the
Purple Finch, Towhee the Chewink, Mrs.
Phoebe Bird, Shrike the Butcher Bird, Mr.
Woodpecker, Mr. and Mrs. Pine Grosbeak,
Mr. Crested Flycatcher, and all their families
and friends. They came in dense clouds,
shrieking, crying and making a great noise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run! Run!&#8221; they cried as they flew over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
his head. &#8220;The fire will soon be here,
Bumper! Run for your life!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to,&#8221; said Bumper.</p>

<p>But once more he was so startled by a sudden
interruption that he couldn&#8217;t move. Out
of the bushes appeared Mr. Fox, running as if
his life depended upon it. Bumper crouched
to hide, but Mr. Fox only gave him a side
glance, and shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Run, Bumper! Run to the river! The fire&#8217;s
coming!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper was so surprised that Mr. Fox
should stop long enough to warn him that he
simply stared and waited. Even his worst
enemy wasn&#8217;t entirely bad, not if he would
take the trouble to warn him when a great danger
threatened every living thing in the woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll remember that, and not think so badly
of Mr. Fox,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Then he thought of his own safety, and was
ready once more to run home to warn his people
of the danger; but out of the bushes at his
feet came a pitiful wailing cry. Bumper
stopped, and looked down. It was little
Spotty the Chameleon, whose bright colors
now were all dark and splotched.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Bumper,&#8221; he wailed, &#8220;I can&#8217;t get away
from the fire. I hurt my leg, and can&#8217;t run at
all. I&#8217;ll be roasted alive.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>Bumper was horrified, and stopped to console
him, but the air was getting thick with
smoke, and he knew that he would have to run
if he expected to save his own life. But he
couldn&#8217;t leave Spotty behind to be burnt up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hop on my back, Spotty, and cling to
it,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Spotty glad of the chance climbed up, and
Bumper started on a mad race through the
bushes. In the next story you will read of
Bumper&#8217;s further adventures in the fire.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STORY VII<br />

<small><span class="smcap">Bumper&#8217;s Mad Race With the Fire</span></small></h2></div>


<p>With Spotty the Chameleon clinging to his
back, Bumper hopped along as fast as he could
to get away from the fire. He was very sure
now that it was spreading throughout the
woods, for the sun had almost disappeared
from view, and the air was thick with choking
smoke and fine cinders.</p>

<p>If he needed any further evidence, he had
but to look around him and above. The woods
were full of big and little animals rushing
toward the river for safety, and the air overhead
was clouded with flocks of birds winging
their way swiftly in the same direction.</p>

<p>Cries of fear came from every side&mdash;calls
and shouts and whistles. Pandemonium had
broken loose. Every one was confused and
frightened. All fears of their bitter enemies
had been forgotten. Curly the Skunk was racing
side by side with Sneaky the Wolf, and
Washer the Raccoon with Buster the Bear.
Even Loup the Lynx was so terrified that he
forgot to snarl when Sleepy the Opossum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
bumped against him, and Killer the Snake
wriggled past Hoppy the Toad who was still
busily digging his hole to crawl in out of
danger.</p>

<p>No one seemed to notice Bumper hopping
along with Spotty the Chameleon on his back.
Ordinarily such a thing would have caused a
laugh, and perhaps jeers. But now every one
was so terrified that he paid no attention to
any one else.</p>

<p>In leaping over a clump of bushes, Bumper
suddenly heard a voice call to him. &#8220;Oh,
Bumper, what am I going to do? I can&#8217;t run
fast enough to beat the fire. Oh! Oh! I shall
be roasted alive!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper stopped and looked down at Lazy
the Snail, who was making all the haste he
could to get away; but it was a ludicrously
slow pace. It seemed as if he almost stood
still when he was crawling the fastest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Lazy, can&#8217;t you run faster?&#8221; Bumper
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you can see I&#8217;m doing my best. I never
was much of a runner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think not,&#8221; laughed Bumper. &#8220;I
might give you a lift of a few yards, but that
wouldn&#8217;t do much good. The fire would soon
catch up to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that wouldn&#8217;t save me,&#8221; wailed Lazy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
&#8220;Nothing will save me. I&#8217;m going to be
roasted alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper looked distressed. The thought of
leaving Lazy behind to be burnt up was more
than he could stand. Spotty the Chameleon
clinging to his back had already become a burden
to him, and he felt that another on his
back would handicap him dreadfully. However,
he couldn&#8217;t leave Lazy the Snail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crawl up on my back, Lazy, and I&#8217;ll carry
you,&#8221; he said finally. &#8220;But you must hurry!
The fire&#8217;s coming very fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lazy was so slow in crawling up that
Bumper several times grew impatient and
urged him to hurry. When he was finally on
one shoulder, clinging to it with his moist feet,
Bumper started off once more. He had to
make up for lost time, and he hopped along at
the top of his speed.</p>

<p>All the while he was thinking of Fuzzy
Wuzz and Old Blind Rabbit. Would they
run for the river, or would they wait for him
to return? It distressed him to think that he
had not been able to warn Whip-Poor-Will
and Hermit the Thrush as he had promised.
Would they wait for him?</p>

<p>He put forth all his strength to gain on the
other animals, and soon found himself in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
lead again. He passed Buster the Bear and
Billy the Mink and Sleepy the Opossum.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could run as fast as you, Bumper,&#8221;
Sleepy wailed. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll be too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, there&#8217;s time enough, Billy,&#8221; replied
Bumper. &#8220;I want to run ahead to warn
Fuzzy Wuzz and Old Blind Rabbit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;ll know the fire&#8217;s coming long before
you reach home. Won&#8217;t you wait for
me? I&#8217;m terribly frightened, and if you
leave me behind I know I&#8217;ll die.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper slowed down to comfort Billy. He
ran alongside of him for a time to keep him
company. This put new heart in Billy, and of
course hope gave him strength and he really
ran faster than before.</p>

<p>They nearly stumbled over White-Foot the
Deer Mouse, who had been running as fast as
his little legs would permit him. But he
curled up now, and stopped, panting for
breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, White Foot?&#8221; asked
Bumper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all in,&#8221; panted White Foot. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
run another step. I&#8217;ve run all the way from
Bald Mountain today, and I&#8217;m too tired to
take another step.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the fire will catch you here,&#8221; protested
Bumper. &#8220;You must try again.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t. I tell you I&#8217;m exhausted, and
my feet are bleeding.&#8221;</p>

<p>He held up a foot that was covered with
blood. Bumper&#8217;s pity for him was more than
he could express in words. &#8220;Crawl upon my
back, White Foot. I guess I can carry another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Bumper! You will save my
life if you carry me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And White Foot the Deer Mouse hopped
up by the side of Lazy the Snail and Spotty
the Chameleon. With this added burden
Bumper found that he couldn&#8217;t run much
faster than Sleepy the Opossum.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to keep company with you now,
Billy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t run faster with so
many on my back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you carry them, Bumper?&#8221; asked
Sleepy. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you let them look out for
themselves?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For shame on you, Sleepy! Would you
leave them behind to be burnt up? No, no,
we can&#8217;t do that. We must help each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that anybody&#8217;s helping me,&#8221;
growled Sleepy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I was helping you by keeping
you company,&#8221; replied Bumper. &#8220;If it isn&#8217;t
doing you any good, I may as well run ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, don&#8217;t leave me!&#8221; cried Sleepy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
&#8220;You are helping me. I didn&#8217;t mean what I
was saying before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, then! Don&#8217;t grumble because
somebody else is having an easier time than
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were approaching the river where it
was broad and deep, and some of the animals
ahead were squealing and grunting with pleasure.
Once across the river, they would be safe
from the flames.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll soon be there!&#8221; exclaimed
Bumper hopefully. &#8220;I can smell the water,
Billy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of it, for I&#8217;m nearly dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little squeaking voice suddenly startled
them, and out of a hole in the nearest tree
popped the head of Stripe the Chipmunk.
&#8220;Bumper! Bumper!&#8221; he squealed in his
high, piping voice. &#8220;Is it true the woods are
on fire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Stripe, and you&#8217;d better hurry to the
river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t! I broke my leg last week, and
I can&#8217;t use it. Do you think I&#8217;ll be safe in this
hole?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, of course not! All the trees will fall
down and be burnt up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll burn with them. Oh! Oh!
What can I do?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>Bumper stopped and looked at him. Stripe
was a fat, healthy fellow, and weighed so much
that Bumper wondered if he could carry him
on his back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to carry you, Stripe,&#8221; he said
finally. &#8220;The river is nearby, and maybe I
can do it. Run up on my back, and hold
tight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sleepy the Opossum gained on Bumper
after that. The white rabbit couldn&#8217;t possibly
keep up with him. But he reached the river
finally, with Stripe the Chipmunk, Lazy the
Snail, Spotty the Chameleon and White Foot
the Deer Mouse clinging to his back. In the
next story you will hear of how they crossed
the river.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STORY VIII<br />

<small><span class="smcap">How They Crossed the River</span></small></h2></div>


<p>It was a strange sight that met them when
they reached the edge of the river. All the
animals of the woods, big and little, four-legged
and two-legged, and those without any
legs, such as Killer the Snake, were congregated
there on the bank. Some of them who
naturally loved the water, such as Billy the
Mink and Browny the Muskrat, were already
in the river, swimming for the other side.</p>

<p>But most of them were waiting, dipping
their feet in the water, and then withdrawing
them. They didn&#8217;t like to take the long swim
unless it was necessary. They kept looking
over their shoulders to see if the fire was near,
and then glancing longingly at the other
shore.</p>

<p>Bumper sighed with relief when he saw
Fuzzy Wuzz, Spotted Tail and Old Blind
Rabbit waiting for him. &#8220;Oh, Bumper, we
were so worried about you!&#8221; exclaimed Fuzzy
Wuzz. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t any need to worry about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
me,&#8221; replied Bumper. &#8220;I can look after myself.
But where&#8217;s Rolly Polly and his family?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re here&mdash;all safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Pink Nose, and Brindley the Lame?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then everything&#8217;s all right,&#8221; sighed
Bumper. &#8220;I was afraid some of them might
get caught.&#8221; Then recalling the distress of
the birds, he asked about Hermit the Thrush
and Mrs. Oven-Bird and Black Cap the
Chickadee. Fuzzy Wuzz laughed and pointed
to the other side.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re on the other side of the river,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;They flew across before we got
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. I almost wish I had wings.
Is the water cold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, terribly,&#8221; replied Fuzzy Wuzz,
shuddering. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we hate to take the
plunge. Ugh! It makes me shiver!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper laughed at her expression. &#8220;When
the fire gets here it will be warm enough,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>Fuzzy Wuzz suddenly grew grave and serious.
&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad about Bobby Gray Squirrel,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with Bobby?&#8221; asked
Bumper.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you heard? He&#8217;s been sick, and
when we passed his hole he was too weak to
follow us. We called to him, but he couldn&#8217;t
come with us. He tried it, but he fell out of
the tree, and I&#8217;m afraid he hurt himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Bumper. &#8220;Bobby
Gray Squirrel&#8217;s back there in the woods!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded Fuzzy Wuzz.</p>

<p>Bumper turned around. &#8220;I must go and
help him,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t leave him to die
such a horrible death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you can&#8217;t do anything, Bumper,&#8221;
pleaded Fuzzy Wuzz. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t go
back. You&#8217;ll be killed by the fire, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t leave Bobby,&#8221; replied Bumper.
&#8220;No, no, I must try to help him. I&#8217;ll go back
before it&#8217;s too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what will become of me?&#8221; piped up
a little voice near his ear, and Spotty the
Chameleon changed from a bright green to a
sickly yellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; Bumper replied, &#8220;you must get
across some other way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to swim,&#8221; piped up White Foot the
Deer Mouse. &#8220;I feel quite rested now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have to swim across,&#8221; said Lazy the
Snail. &#8220;I&#8217;ll crawl down into the wet mud and
be safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t very well swim with a broken leg,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
said Stripe the Chipmunk, &#8220;but if you&#8217;ll put
me on a chip I can float down the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper had forgotten his little charges, and
for a moment he was distressed. Then he said
to Fuzzy Wuzz: &#8220;Find a chip for Stripe so
he can float on it, and then swim along by
White Foot to see that he doesn&#8217;t get exhausted.
I&#8217;ll get Pink Nose to carry Spotty
across on his back. He&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hopped away, and soon brought Pink
Nose back with him, who promised to look
out for the Chameleon. Lazy said good-bye,
and began burrowing into the soft mud.
Fuzzy Wuzz put Stripe the Chipmunk on a
big chip, and then started to swim across with
White Foot the Deer Mouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now all of you get across,&#8221; Bumper commanded,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ll go back to see if I can do
anything for Bobby Gray Squirrel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Bumper, do be careful, and return
soon,&#8221; pleaded Fuzzy Wuzz.</p>

<p>Bumper promised, and then dashed back
into the woods. In a very short time he found
the smoke growing so dense that it made him
gasp. But he raced on directly toward the approaching
fire. Pretty soon hot, scorching
cinders fell about him, and he could hear the
roar of the flames.</p>

<p>The bright light ahead told him he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
nearly upon the fire, but he loped along, making
straight for Bobby&#8217;s tree. When he
reached it he began calling frantically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bobby! Bobby!&#8221;</p>

<p>A weak little voice responded, and Bumper
jumped to where it came from. There curled
up in the leaves at the bottom of the big tree
was Bobby Gray Squirrel too sick to care
whether the fire was near or not.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;d you come back for, Bumper?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;To save you,&#8221; was the quick reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t do it. I&#8217;m too sick and weak to
walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then get on my back, and hold tight. I&#8217;ll
carry you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Bumper, you couldn&#8217;t do it. I&#8217;m too
heavy for you. Run along and save yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get on my back, Bobby, and stop talking!
Quick now, or we&#8217;ll both be scorched. The
fire&#8217;s nearly here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still protesting, Bobby finally obeyed. He
was almost as big as Bumper, but not so fat
and heavy, and to hold himself on he had to
cling to the white rabbit&#8217;s neck. This choked
Bumper, and made it more difficult for him to
run.</p>

<p>But he couldn&#8217;t stop for that. He had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
hurry, or both of them would be killed by the
fire. He hopped along slowly with his burden,
and the fire seemed to gain on them. In
vain he tried to run faster, but he was doing
all he could. His strength was giving out
rapidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can never swim the river with him,&#8221; he
kept thinking. &#8220;I&#8217;ll drown surely, but that&#8217;s
better than being burnt alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he finally reached the water he was
too exhausted to jump in. Bobby realized
that it was impossible to go further. &#8220;You go
alone, Bumper, and leave me,&#8221; Bobby said.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t swim, but you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t swim either,&#8221; panted Bumper.
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any strength left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; a gruff voice called back of them.
&#8220;Who can&#8217;t swim, and why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster the Bear stood back of them ready
to plunge in the river. Bumper explained in
a few words what he had done, and what he
hoped to do. Buster looked at him with a
curious expression in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s too bad to spoil
a good thing. I guess I&#8217;ll have to take a hand
in it. Now both of you jump on my back, and
I&#8217;ll get you across. I don&#8217;t mind a little swim
like that.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i070.jpg" alt="In this way Bumper and Bobby crossed the river" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">In this way Bumper and Bobby crossed the river</span></p>

<p>Buster was in earnest and when he invited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
them both to get on his back the second time,
Bobby crawled up and clung to his thick wool,
but Bumper had to perch on his head so he
wouldn&#8217;t lose his balance. Then, grinning at
the queer burden he was carrying, Buster
waded out until the water was over his head,
and then began swimming. In this way
Bumper and Bobby Gray Squirrel crossed the
river to a place of safety. They were the last
of the animals of the North Woods to get away
from the fire.</p>

<p>If Buster doesn&#8217;t decide to eat them, or the
river doesn&#8217;t dry up, you&#8217;ll hear in the next
story what happened to them on the other side.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STORY IX<br />

<small><span class="smcap">The Truce</span></small></h2></div>


<p>That was a great ride across the river on
Buster&#8217;s back. Bobby Gray Squirrel had no
difficulty in clinging to the Bear&#8217;s thick wool,
for his claws were made to dig into things and
hold on; but Bumper felt like a shipwrecked
mariner riding the waves on a cockle-shell.
Every time Buster pitched forward, or turned
his head sideways or looked up at the sky,
Bumper clutched with all four paws at the
shaggy head, and felt that he would be
dumped into the water to finish the trip alone.
It was a balancing act with him that made
every moment perilous and uncertain.</p>

<p>Now all the other animals and birds who
had escaped from the fire were lined upon the
shore, and when they saw Buster the Bear
swimming toward them with Bumper the
White Rabbit perched on his head and Bobby
Gray Squirrel clinging to his back they stared
in amazement, rubbing their eyes, and wondering
if they were seeing things that were
really not so. Then as the truth of the funny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
sight dawned upon them, they sat up a shout of
welcome. The birds whistled; the animals
barked or squealed; Killer the Snake squirmed
and hissed, and Rolly Polly and Pink Nose lay
back and laughed until the tears streamed
down their cheeks.</p>

<p>Suddenly a loud, harsh &#8220;Ha! Ha! Ha!&#8221;
rose above the din. It was Mr. Crow laughing
at the funny picture.</p>

<p>The others immediately changed their tune,
and the woods rang with laughter. Even
Sneaky the Wolf showed his teeth in a grin,
and made a noise that sounded like a chuckle
and Mr. Fox rolled over and over in convulsions
of merriment.</p>

<p>Shrike the Butcher Bird screamed with delight,
and forgot his grudge against the other
birds, and Singer the Mocking Bird began
imitating the cries and chuckles of the others
until the forest fairly bubbled with mirthful
sounds. Buster didn&#8217;t quite understand the
meaning of it all, but after a while, puffing
and panting, he reached shallow water, and
began wading ashore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they laughing at us?&#8221; he asked suddenly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s no laughing matter,&#8221; he added
with a growl. He objected to being made the
butt of a joke, although he liked to play jokes
on others.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>&#8220;They don&#8217;t mean anything unkind, Buster,&#8221;
Bumper said. &#8220;They are happy to think
you&#8217;ve saved us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! That&#8217;s a funny way to show it,&#8221;
snorted Buster.</p>

<p>And when he crawled up on dry land, and
saw Sneaky the Wolf grinning, he cuffed him
on the ear, and added:</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you see that&#8217;s so funny, Sneaky?
I didn&#8217;t see you saving anybody but your own
skin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sneaky snarled and drew away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t as thoughtful as you, Buster,&#8221; he
sneered. &#8220;If I had been I&#8217;d carried over two
or three rabbits to eat when I got ashore. But
Bobby and Bumper will only make a mouthful
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think I saved them to eat them?&#8221;
snapped Buster angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, certainly,&#8221; politely replied Sneaky
drawing away from the big paws. &#8220;What
else would you save them for?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bobby and Bumper didn&#8217;t like the expression
on Sneaky&#8217;s face, and they felt like running
and hiding, but they decided Buster was a
good enough protector for them, and they remained
close by his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Buster saved them for us,&#8221; remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Mr. Fox slyly. &#8220;We ought to thank him for
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here, Mr. Fox, and thank me,&#8221;
snarled Buster, turning suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; replied Mr. Fox, trotting
to a safe distance. &#8220;I can thank you here just
as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now that they were all safe on the other
side of the river, the old hunting instincts of
the bigger animals were returning, and the
natural timidity of the smaller ones began to
show itself. While caught in the fire a truce
had been declared, but they were all safe now.</p>

<p>Brindley the Lame, Crooked Ears, Pink
Nose and Rolly Polly began calling their families
together to hide in the bushes, and Sleepy
the Opossum was taking to the nearest tree,
and Browny the Muskrat was hunting for a
convenient hole. The birds were also separating
according to their clans&mdash;the song birds
and thrushes on one side, and Dasher the
Hawk, Great Horn the Owl and Baldy the
Eagle on the other. Loup the Lynx, who had
been resting in the crotch of a tree after his
long swim, was crouching and viewing the
smaller animals with fierce, hungry eyes.</p>

<p>Bumper saw in a glance that war was about
to be declared, and all his people without
homes or any secret hiding place would become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
easy prey to their enemies. His soul
troubled him. The slaughter might be almost
as great as if they had all been caught in
the fire. He felt called upon to do something
to avert the tragedy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buster, let me speak to them,&#8221; he said suddenly,
hopping back on the top of the Bear&#8217;s
head where he could look around and see
everyone. The sight of the white rabbit on
Buster&#8217;s head once more excited amusement.</p>

<p>Mr. Crow started off with his loud &#8220;Ha!
Ha!&#8221; and Singer the Mocking Bird repeated
it. The others couldn&#8217;t resist it, and they all
began laughing again. Bumper felt pleased
at this, for when an animal is laughing he
can&#8217;t be very dangerous.</p>

<p>Smiling and bowing, Bumper finally raised
a paw, and said: &#8220;Now that we&#8217;re safe from
the fire, we must begin life again on this side
of the river. It&#8217;s all new to us, and not one of
us has a home. Sneaky and Loup and Mr. Fox
were very kind to us when we were caught in
the fire. Not one of them tried to kill us.
We&#8217;re going to thank them for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sleepy the Opossum, Washer the Raccoon,
Mr. Beaver, Curly the Skunk and all the others
nodded their heads, and expressed their
thanks in their different ways. Bumper raised
his head, and added: &#8220;Also we must thank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Baldy the Eagle for not attacking the birds,
and Dasher the Hawk and Great Horn the
Owl. Instead of attacking us Baldy actually
gave us warning of the fire, and in that way
helped us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldy looked a little pleased at this, and
nodded his head. Great Horn ruffled his
feathers in pride, and blinked hard at the sun.
Bumper saw that his flattery had a good effect,
and while they were still in a pleasant
mood he made haste to propose his plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re going to give us another
chance,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;None of us has a
home, and it will take several days for all of
us to make new ones. Baldy wants to find a
new one for his mate, and Loup is anxious to
please Mrs. Loup, who is waiting for him.
Now why not declare a truce for two days
until we can all get settled again on this side of
the river? Isn&#8217;t that fair?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sneaky and Mr. Fox looked a little uncertain,
but Mrs. Loup the Lynx settled it for her
lord and husband. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that&#8217;s
fair. Come on, Loup, and help me find a new
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldy&#8217;s mate, who was a little cross at being
driven away from her nest on Bald Mountain,
was equally anxious to begin housekeeping in
their new place. She whispered a word or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
two, and Baldy flapped his wings, and the two
flew away together.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about you, Sneaky and Mr. Fox?&#8221;
growled Buster, turning to these two. &#8220;Are
you going to live up to the truce?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;er&mdash;&#8221; stammered Mr. Fox.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t,&#8221; interrupted Buster, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
make you. To tell you the truth, I&#8217;d like a
few boxing lessons with you and Sneaky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, of course, we agree,&#8221; replied Mr.
Fox and Sneaky hurriedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the meeting is over,&#8221; declared
Buster. &#8220;Now every one trot away, and begin
house hunting. Is that right, Bumper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Buster,&#8221; replied the white rabbit,
climbing down. &#8220;And if you ever need a
friend, don&#8217;t forget that Bobby and I owe our
lives to you. We can never thank you
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right!&#8221; grinned Buster, as he
lumbered away. So the meeting was ended,
and the animals and birds began to separate.
How they found new homes in the woods, and
the adventures that befell them will be told in
the next story.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">House Hunting in the Woods</span></small></h2></div>


<p>The great fire that had swept away the
woods in which they had always lived made
every one of the birds and animals homeless.
Of course, they were thankful they had escaped
the flames, but they had lost all their
possessions. Nobody had carried anything
away with him.</p>

<p>The next two days were spent in house
hunting. They were busy days you can
imagine. It is no easy thing for even the birds
and animals to pick up a home and start housekeeping
again. There are so many things to
consider.</p>

<p>For instance, the first hole Washer the Raccoon
entered was the entrance to an ideal home
for him, but Billy the Porcupine entered from
another side at the same time. A dispute immediately
followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my home,&#8221; said Billy, bristling up
his spines.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t,&#8221; retorted Washer. &#8220;I got here
first.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>&#8220;No such thing. I discovered it first. Because
you can run faster doesn&#8217;t matter. It&#8217;s
the question of which discovers it first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possession is half the law,&#8221; retorted
Washer, showing his teeth. &#8220;And I have possession.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you prove that when I&#8217;m in possession,
too?&#8221; snapped Billy. &#8220;I&#8217;m here, and
you can&#8217;t put me out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can, and will,&#8221; said Washer, and he made
a quick dart at Billy, who curled up so suddenly
that his sharp spines bristled on every
side.</p>

<p>Washer danced around him, but he was unable
to get at Billy, who laughed and shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now who&#8217;s got possession?&#8221;</p>

<p>Washer wasn&#8217;t to be bullied, however, and
retorted: &#8220;I&#8217;ll starve you out. You don&#8217;t dare
uncurl. If you do I&#8217;ll get you. Now we&#8217;ll see
who owns the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Billy had a ready answer. &#8220;If I starve
you&#8217;ll starve too. The minute you go out for
food, I&#8217;ll go too. Now what are you going to
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Washer recognized the truth of this, and
was silent. He watched Billy with angry eyes,
but he was still afraid of the bristling ball of
sharp quills. They were in this attitude of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
waiting when Bumper appeared at the mouth
of the hole.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he exclaimed, addressing Fuzzy
Wuzz. &#8220;This looks like a promising place.
Let&#8217;s investigate it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ran in the hole, and came up against
Washer the Raccoon. &#8220;You in here, Washer?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you were here. Then
I must look for some other place for a home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m here,&#8221; replied Washer crossly.
&#8220;And so is Billy the Porcupine. There he is
sulking in the corner. He refused to leave
when I ordered him out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He had no right to order me away,
Bumper,&#8221; Billy said, uncurling. &#8220;I discovered
the hole first, and came here to claim it
for a home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I beat him down here,&#8221; interrupted
Washer, &#8220;and the one that gets first in a hole
has a right to it. Isn&#8217;t that the law of the
woods, Bumper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; said Bumper, scratching his
nose thoughtfully. &#8220;You&#8217;re both right, I suppose,
but one must be wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I discovered it first,&#8221; interrupted Billy,
&#8220;and that made it mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I was first down here,&#8221; said Washer
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; remarked Bumper, &#8220;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
this is a knotty question to settle. Suppose you
both give it up, and then neither will have the
advantage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; growled Washer. &#8220;You want it
for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why I should give it up,&#8221; added
Billy, &#8220;not even to you, Bumper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You misunderstand me, Billy. I didn&#8217;t
want it for myself, but you and Washer can&#8217;t
stand here forever disputing about the ownership.
You&#8217;d never get settled. We want peace
in the new woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dispute might have lasted indefinitely,
for Bumper was puzzled how to settle it; but
just as he was thinking he would have to give
it up Groundy the Woodchuck rushed down
the hole, and seeing so many there he stopped
in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! I didn&#8217;t know I had company in
my new home!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m
glad to see all of you. It&#8217;s a nice comfortable
home, isn&#8217;t it? Almost as good as the one I
had in the North Woods. Welcome all of
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if that isn&#8217;t the limit!&#8221; exclaimed
Washer.</p>

<p>&#8220;The idea!&#8221; said Billy, uncurling a little
more. &#8220;I guess you don&#8217;t own the whole
woods, Groundy.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t claim any such thing, Billy,&#8221;
replied Groundy. &#8220;But I do claim this place.
Why shouldn&#8217;t I? I discovered it first, and
started to make my nest here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did, eh?&#8221; snapped Washer. &#8220;I was
the first one down here, and it&#8217;s mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I discovered it first, and it&#8217;s mine,&#8221; echoed
Billy.</p>

<p>Bumper saw that the dispute was likely to
cause hard feeling between the three friends,
and he wished to settle it in a friendly way.</p>

<p>&#8220;When did you find it, Groundy?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;And were you down here before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, hours ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve been here for ever and ever so
long,&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;Washer knows that, for
he&#8217;s been here too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we came in here a long time ago, and
Groundy wasn&#8217;t in sight then. I don&#8217;t believe
he was ever here before. He&#8217;s just saying that
to claim the hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>Groundy showed some impatience, and
then spying something way down in the bottom
of the burrow he smiled. Washer and
Billy, who had joined together to dispute his
right, looked in the same direction, but they
could see nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I prove that I discovered the burrow
first, and was down here before either Billy or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Washer, is it my home?&#8221; Groundy asked,
turning to Bumper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s only fair. It&#8217;s the law of the
woods, and Billy and Washer should agree to
it. You will, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned and addressed the two sulking
animals.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I will,&#8221; Billy assented after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;I too,&#8221; said Washer, &#8220;but he&#8217;s got to prove
it, and not make up a story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll prove it,&#8221; smiled Groundy. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
have to make up any story. Billy, look in the
corner there and tell me what&#8217;s under those
leaves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy wondering what he meant by this remark
obeyed. There was a big ball of leaves
at the bottom that he hadn&#8217;t noticed there before,
and when he pawed around in them there
was a little squeak, and up popped the heads
of three little woodchucks. They were the
children of Groundy, which he and Mrs.
Groundy had brought from their old home
safely across the river. They were stowed away
snugly in the hole, and had been fast asleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how&#8217;d they get down here?&#8221; gasped
Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I brought them here hours ago,&#8221; replied
Groundy. &#8220;That&#8217;s my evidence that I was
here before either you or Washer.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>Washer laughed good-naturedly. &#8220;I guess
you&#8217;ve proved your point, Groundy, and I for
one will leave. I couldn&#8217;t drive out those dear
little woodchucks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor me either,&#8221; said Billy, smiling down
at the sleepy youngsters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I guess we&#8217;d all better leave,&#8221; remarked
Bumper, &#8220;and let Groundy have the
burrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the dispute of ownership was settled, and
all hopped away, leaving Groundy in possession.
The next story will be about how
Bumper settled a dispute between Pink Nose
and Rolly Polly.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STORY XI<br />

<small><span class="smcap">Pink Nose and Rolly Polly</span></small></h2></div>


<p>Bumper, finding that Groundy was entitled
to the burrow he and Fuzzy Wuzz had entered,
hopped away in search of another place.
Of course, there had been a grand scramble in
the woods for the choice sites. Just like people
when new land is thrown open for settlement,
every one of the animals made a rush for
the best holes.</p>

<p>This naturally caused all sorts of conflicts,
and disputes rose on every side. The choicest
places were close to the river where they
would have water right at their door. But
Billy the Mink and Browny the Muskrat had
the first right to these water sites, for they
couldn&#8217;t live inland. Their homes had to be
near or under the water. Mr. Beaver likewise
had to have a swimming pool adjoining
his home, and he came in next for river views.</p>

<p>Fortunately Sneaky the Wolf and Mr.
Fox, as well as Loup the Lynx, preferred dens
in the very heart of the woods, and they
prowled around in the thickest places, leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the smaller animals to dispute about sites
on the water front.</p>

<p>Even the rabbits wanted to be within a
short distance of the river. &#8220;If we have a fire
on this side some day,&#8221; remarked Pink Nose,
&#8220;I want to be so close to the river I can cross
it in the middle of the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness me!&#8221; exclaimed Rolly Polly.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak about another fire! I don&#8217;t think
I could go through another one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It frightened me so,&#8221; said Crooked Ears,
&#8220;that I&#8217;m sure some of my hairs turned gray.
Certainly I feel years older.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; added Brindley the Lame, &#8220;it was a
terrible experience, but finding new homes
for all our families is nearly as heart-rending.
I declare, I&#8217;ve hunted nearly everywhere, and
haven&#8217;t found a place yet to suit me. When
I do find one that seems just right somebody
is ahead of me and takes possession.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That reminds me,&#8221; laughed Bumper, &#8220;of
the experience of Billy Porcupine and
Washer the Raccoon. They thought they
both discovered a home at the same time, and
neither would give in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he related the story of how Groundy
the Woodchuck had proven to them that
neither one had any right to the burrow, for
he had been ahead of them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>&#8220;Ha! Ha!&#8221; laughed Rolly Polly. &#8220;That
was a good one, and served Billy and Washer
right for being so selfish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they both thought they were right,&#8221;
said Bumper, &#8220;yet one of them must have
been wrong. Which would you say was in
the right, Rolly Polly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither,&#8221; was the prompt retort. &#8220;They
were both wrong, and very selfish. If each
had given in to the other there would have
been no dispute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you have given in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly! Who wouldn&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I would,&#8221; said Pink Nose. &#8220;I
quite agree with Rolly Polly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad to hear it,&#8221; said Bumper,
smiling. &#8220;There wouldn&#8217;t be any disputes if
all were as unselfish as you and Rolly Polly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps Pink Nose and Rolly Polly
thought they would be unselfish, and they
could condemn Billy and Washer without
having to be put to a real test. But sometimes
when we boast of our virtues we soon get in a
fix where we have to prove our words. Now
this was just what happened to Rolly Polly
and Pink Nose.</p>

<p>They started out shortly in different directions
to renew the search for a home site.
Rolly Polly, after much wandering around,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
came to a clump of trees which seemed to offer
an ideal home for his family.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll burrow down under that big tree,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and make a spacious home for my
little ones. The dirt is soft and smooth here,
and the roots of the tree will make a good
foundation for the tunnels.&#8221;</p>

<p>Satisfied that he had at last found just what
he had been looking for, he began digging.
First he dug straight down a foot under the
biggest root, and then ran his tunnel along
under the tree. When he reached the middle
he intended to run tunnels on either side, and
build his burrow.</p>

<p>He worked hard for several hours until the
hole was big enough to suit him. &#8220;I must be
nearly under the middle of the tree,&#8221; he
mused, and stopped to rest a minute.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a noise of scratching
and scraping. At first he thought it was outside,
and he lay very quiet in the hole, but a
moment later he was sure that the digging
came from underneath. A little frightened,
he waited and listened.</p>

<p>Some animal was digging down on the opposite
side of the big tree. Rolly Polly was
ready to run if the animal proved to be an
enemy, but before he could leave the dirt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
crumbled before him, and the head of Pink
Nose was thrust through the opening.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a scare you gave me!&#8221; exclaimed
Rolly Polly. &#8220;I thought the Hound or Mr.
Fox was after me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You gave me a shock, too,&#8221; replied Pink
Nose. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you were here until I
saw you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve found a home for my family at
last. I chose this big tree, and I&#8217;ve dug a tunnel
clear under it. But what are you doing,
Pink Nose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Digging a burrow for my family. Can&#8217;t
you see for yourself? I started on the other
side of the tree, and I&#8217;ve dug clear down to
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but you can&#8217;t have this place,&#8221; protested
Rolly Polly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve selected it for my
burrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ve selected it for mine. See what a
long tunnel I&#8217;ve dug.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not longer than mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, it is. Just to show you I&#8217;ll measure
it, and then we&#8217;ll measure yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right! It&#8217;s agreed that the one who&#8217;s
dug the longest tunnel has the place for his
burrow. Is that right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll agree to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>They measured first one, and then the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Then they measured them again, and frowned.
They were exactly the same length.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now what are you going to do?&#8221; asked
Pink Nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay here, of course. I have as much right
as you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll stay, too. You can&#8217;t frighten me
away, and I don&#8217;t intend to have all my work
for nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper found them in this unyielding state
of mind, with neither one willing to give way
to the other. Recalling their remarks about
Billy Porcupine and Washer the Raccoon,
Bumper smiled to himself. After all they
were not much less selfish than Billy and
Washer when put to the real test. It is always
easier to preach than practice.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; Bumper remarked after
a while, &#8220;that we&#8217;d better make a two-family
house out of this burrow. That&#8217;s the simplest
solution of the problem.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can we do that?&#8221; asked Rolly Polly.
&#8220;I never heard of such a thing. My family
could never live with Pink Nose&#8217;s family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but you could dig to the right, and
Pink Nose to the left, starting from this meeting
point,&#8221; Bumper explained. &#8220;Your burrow
would be on the right, and Pink Nose&#8217;s
on the left, and you could each use your own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
entrance to it. Then you wouldn&#8217;t have to do
the work you&#8217;ve done all over again.&#8221;</p>

<p>This pleased both of them, and they began
burrowing to the right and left until they had
the first two-family house ever built in the
woods. Each had its separate entrance, which
met in a common hall at their doors. The
next story will tell of Downy the Woodpecker
and Belt the Sapsucker.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Downy the Woodpecker and Belt the
Sapsucker</span></small></h2></div>


<p>Not all the trouble in establishing themselves
in the new woods was confined to the
animals. The coming of so many birds across
the river all at once, each without a home or
nesting place, caused a great amount of confusion.
There were trees aplenty, but not
every tree is suitable for a bird&#8217;s nest.</p>

<p>Piney the Purple Finch, for instance,
wanted the same high branch to build his nest
on that Mr. Pine Grosbeak had chosen, and
they quarreled over it until Shrike the
Butcher Bird came along and drove them
both away with his shrill cries and threatening
manner. Yellow Breast the Chat found a
tangled thicket under a big pine for his home,
but Towhee the Chewink objected, for he had
made his new home in that thicket. Hermit
the Thrush had been fortunate in finding an
ideal home for her brood, and was perfectly
satisfied until she found Great Horn the Owl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
had taken possession of a hole in a rotten tree
branch directly over her head.</p>

<p>And so it was with all the others. There
were confusion and disputes and mistakes, and
all sorts of heart aches and disappointment.
But the saddest was the trouble between
Downy the Woodpecker and Belt the Sapsucker.</p>

<p>Now Downy and Belt were close relations,
first cousins, in fact, and they should have
known better; but then relatives, even brothers
and sisters, sometimes have their quarrels,
and we can&#8217;t entirely blame Belt and Downy.</p>

<p>It was this way. Downy found a hole in
the rotten trunk of a tall tree, and immediately
began hollowing it out a little more so he
could build his nest at the bottom. Then
Belt, who had had poor luck finding a place
for his home, saw the tree, and immediately
became jealous of his cousin. And envy generally
breeds unpleasant thoughts and deeds.
Belt determined to drive Downy away by
methods that later he was ashamed of.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re surely not going to build your nest
in that hole Downy!&#8221; Belt exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes, I am! Why shouldn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you want Hoot the Owl in your
family it&#8217;s none of my affair,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoot the Owl! Is he around here?&#8221; exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Downy, in genuine surprise and
alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Around here!&#8221; laughed Belt. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t
you see him digging out that hole to build his
nest? Surely you must see marks of his claws
in the wood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Downy was so frightened that he thought
he saw the marks of Hoot&#8217;s claws all around
him. Yes, he was certain that the hole had
been dug out by Hoot, and he could smell the
odors of the owl at the bottom now that his attention
was called to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for telling me, Belt,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Of course, I don&#8217;t want to build anywhere
near Hoot. No, no, not within a mile of him.
I&#8217;ll go as far away as I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he flew away, leaving Belt in possession.
It was a wicked trick, but Belt felt that
the circumstances warranted a little deception.
He wanted the hole in the worst way,
and now that Downy had abandoned it, why,
of course, he had a right to take it. He began
almost immediately to fix it up. He dug
a little deeper into the heart of the tree with
his strong bill until he had a hole that just satisfied
him.</p>

<p>Then he flew away to gather leaves and
grass for the nest. He made many trips until
the nest was nearly all built. He wanted it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
finished before Mrs. Belt arrived, but night
came with it only three-quarters finished.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll sleep in it tonight,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and then finish it early in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went to bed early, as all self-respecting
birds do, and was fast asleep shortly after
dusk. He was dreaming of pleasant things
when he was suddenly awakened by a noise
outside. He sat up and listened. It was Mr.
Hoot the Owl and his mate sitting on the doorstep
of his home talking.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think this hole will do very well for us,&#8221;
Hoot was saying. &#8220;It&#8217;s the best I can find.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Mrs. Hoot. &#8220;We
might find a better place if we looked further.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t we looked all over the woods?&#8221;
asked Hoot impatiently. &#8220;I&#8217;m dreadfully
tired, and this house hunting tires me more
than anything else in the world. The last
place I selected you didn&#8217;t like because it was
too near the river, and now this one is way
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too far away from all my friends, too,&#8221;
objected Mrs. Hoot. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like to live off
alone. I want to be near other people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s it&mdash;always objecting!&#8221; exclaimed
Hoot irritably. &#8220;Well, then, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
can find a better place go and look for it.
This suits me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now please don&#8217;t get angry,&#8221; replied Mrs.
Hoot. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t say this place didn&#8217;t please
me. I can&#8217;t tell until we look it over. Suppose
we go inside and see how it is in there.
Of course, there will have to be many improvements
made. I never saw a house ready-made
for me that was satisfactory in all respects.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; replied Hoot. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll look
inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>You can imagine Belt&#8217;s feelings! There he
was shut up in the hole with Hoot the Owl
coming down to look around. Oh, what could
he do! Why had he deceived Downy! Now
he was going to be punished for his lie.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I ever get out of here alive,&#8221;
he breathed, &#8220;I&#8217;ll never tell another lie. I&#8217;ll
never deceive any one again.&#8221;</p>

<p>But of course this didn&#8217;t get him out. Nothing
could! The entrance was blocked by Hoot
and his mate. Then he heard Hoot scrambling
through the opening. In another minute
he would discover Belt crouched at the bottom
of the hole.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, the hole is altogether too small
for us,&#8221; he heard Hoot say. &#8220;No, this will
never suit you. It will take more repairing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
than it&#8217;s worth. I&#8217;ll have to make the entrance
twice as large.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then if we&#8217;re going to look further come
on right away,&#8221; said Mrs. Hoot. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got
to find a suitable place before morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a few more words they flew away.
Belt heard them go, and a great relief came to
him. It seemed too good to be true. He
wasn&#8217;t going to be eaten up after all. He was
so thankful that he said to himself before he
dropped off to sleep again, &#8220;In the morning
I&#8217;ll tell Downy he can have the hole. I&#8217;ll confess
all to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>But when the sun appeared, and Belt
peeped out of the hole to see the light of a new
day, he was so pleased with the beauty of the
woods that he regretted he had decided to give
up his home to Downy. For a moment his decision
wavered. Then he said: &#8220;No, I&#8217;ll keep
my word. I&#8217;ll tell Downy at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>He flew away into the woods until he found
his cousin. Downy listened to his story, and
then shook his head:</p>

<p>&#8220;You deserve the scare you got, Belt, but I
forgive you for telling me that story. However,
I don&#8217;t want the hole. I&#8217;ve found one
that suits me better. You can have the old
one.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i103.jpg" alt="After a few more words they flew away" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">After a few more words they flew away</span></p>

<p>So it really worked out for the best, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Belt took permanent possession of the old
hole, which he took good care not to enlarge
so Hoot could get in, and Downy remained in
happy possession of the new one he had found.</p>

<p>In the next story you will hear how Killer
the Snake broke the truce in the woods and
got himself in trouble.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STORY XIII<br />

<small><span class="smcap">How Killer the Snake Broke the Truce</span></small></h2></div>


<p>Of all the creatures of the woods Killer the
Snake had the reputation for sly deception
that made him the most distrusted. Perhaps
his reputation was not founded upon justice,
but at any rate Bumper was not easy in mind
when Killer crawled away in the bushes, after
the agreement, without a word as to his intentions.</p>

<p>Killer&#8217;s favorite pastime was robbing nests
of their eggs and young birds, or hunting
Hoppy the Toad, which he swallowed whole.
When such food was not to be found, he would
sometimes raid the burrows of the larger animals.
He had been known to run off with the
young of Gray Back the Weasel and Stripe
the Chipmunk.</p>

<p>Bumper&#8217;s fears that Killer might cause
trouble seemed unfounded, however, and
nothing was heard of Killer for the first day
and night. Everybody seemed so busy finding
a home that no one gave any attention to his
coming and going.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>Rusty the Blackbird reported that Killer
was in the thick woods, but what he was doing
there he could not say. He had kept an eye
on him for a time, and then had to fly away to
attend to his own business. The rest of the
birds had not seen him at all, and his presence
was something of a mystery.</p>

<p>On the second day, however, Bumper was
returning to a burrow that he and Fuzzy
Wuzz had discovered for their future home,
when he was startled by the plaintive cries of
Hermit the Thrush among the bushes. At
first Bumper thought Hermit was talking to
her mate, but when the cries increased he
hopped in her direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all the noise about, Hermit?&#8221; he
called. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you find a place for your new
home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Bumper,&#8221; exclaimed Hermit, fluttering
toward him, &#8220;Killer is trying to rob my
nest. I have one egg in it, and he&#8217;s going to
steal it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper gave a big jump through the
bushes, and landed close to the place where
Killer was coiled. Near him was Hermit&#8217;s
nest in a small bush just off the ground. A
tiny greenish egg was in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Killer, if you break the law of the woods
you&#8217;ll be punished,&#8221; Bumper exclaimed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
anger. &#8220;The truce between the animals and
birds hasn&#8217;t ended yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Killer turned defiantly upon the white rabbit,
and hissed: &#8220;Don&#8217;t bother your head,
Bumper. This egg doesn&#8217;t belong to you.
Now run along, and forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember what I did to you the other
day, Killer,&#8221; Bumper replied. &#8220;Well, this
time you won&#8217;t get off so easily. If you don&#8217;t
go away immediately, I&#8217;ll call all the birds
and animals of the woods to punish you. They
will outlaw you, and be your enemy forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t be anything new, Bumper,&#8221;
hissed Killer. &#8220;They&#8217;re my enemies now. I&#8217;m
going to have this egg for my breakfast. I&#8217;m
mighty hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re not,&#8221; answered Bumper,
springing toward him. Killer dodged back
and then shot his head forward as if to strike,
but Bumper dodged and landed on the other
side. His idea was to play the same game on
Killer that had been so successful before but
they were in a tangled thicket now, and not
out in an open space.</p>

<p>He soon found it impossible to run around
Killer in a circle until he got him dizzy
watching. Indeed, Killer had the advantage
of him. He could turn and crawl through the
thicket much faster than the rabbit. Once in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
his effort to escape the darting head of the
snake, Bumper stumbled and got caught in
the bushes. Killer laughed heartily.</p>

<p>&#8220;In another minute I&#8217;d had you,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t play that old trick on me in here.
If you don&#8217;t look out I&#8217;ll get you yet, and
choke you to death. If I once coil my body
around you it will be the last time you&#8217;ll interfere
with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper began to realize that he was in real
danger, for there was little room in the bushes
for him to hop around, and if he got caught
once in the thicket Killer could crawl upon
him and strangle him to death. So he had to
be more cautious. He kept at a greater distance,
but made darts at the serpent as if he
intended to jump at him. Killer approached
nearer, driving him further and further away
from the nest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now come on and fight me,&#8221; Killer jeered.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? Are you afraid of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hermit! Hermit!&#8221; Bumper called over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>When there was no response, Killer laughed
at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hermit&#8217;s left you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She&#8217;s afraid
to stay here. She didn&#8217;t think enough of her
egg to fight for it, but she let you risk your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
life to protect it. Now you see how much
friendship amounts to!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper kept on calling, but Killer was apparently
right. Hermit had left, and was not
within hearing distance. Still for the sake of
making Killer observe the truce, Bumper
stood his ground, and took every advantage he
could to run in and snap his teeth.</p>

<p>In spite of this the snake drove him away,
and then crawled back to the nest. He reached
the bush and started to climb it. Bumper
made a furious rush to frighten him away.
Then he stopped. He couldn&#8217;t go forward
nor backward. He was caught in the thick
bushes, with his plump body jammed in between
two stout saplings and his neck entangled
among briers and bushes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Ha!&#8221; exclaimed Killer jubilantly.
&#8220;You&#8217;re caught now, and I&#8217;ll make short work
of you. After I&#8217;ve strangled you to death, I&#8217;ll
eat the egg at my leisure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper struggled frantically to get loose,
and Killer approached him, with his forked
tongue darting out threateningly. Bumper
suddenly felt weak and faint. The sight of
Killer drawing nearer frightened him. He
could neither run away nor protect himself.</p>

<p>It did seem like the last of Bumper. Killer
was certain that he had him, and Bumper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
thought so too. With his neck caught in the
vines, the rabbit couldn&#8217;t even turn to face his
enemy. But neither one had reckoned with
Hermit the Thrush.</p>

<p>It is true she had flown away, but not for
the purpose of deserting Bumper. She
thought Bumper would keep Killer busy until
she could summon help.</p>

<p>And what a lot of helpers she found! When
Killer was within a foot of Bumper there was
a sudden sound of whirring wings, and the
forest was darkened by the flight of birds that
swooped down upon them. There were Rusty
the Blackbird and his mate, Singer the Mocking
Bird, Piney the Purple Finch, Belt the
Sapsucker, Yellow Breast the Chat, and goodness
knows how many others! It seemed as if
all the birds of the North Woods were there,
whistling, calling, crying and shrieking.</p>

<p>Killer looked up and caught sight of this
great host, and then ducked his head. He
tried to crawl away and hide in the bushes,
but the birds found him and darted down at
him. Their sharp bills caught him in the
head, the body, the tail, and wherever he was
the most sensitive.</p>

<p>Killer tried to fight back at first, but there
were too many for him. They attacked him
on all sides, and punished him so that he ached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and pained all over. Then he ran, and the
birds followed him. Again and again they
pecked him. It was like sticking dozens of
needles in his body.</p>

<p>Finally he discovered a hole in the ground,
and disappeared in it, but not until after he
had been wounded so many times that he
could not count them. It was a proper punishment
for breaking the truce, and the birds
were glad they had been in time to save Hermit&#8217;s
egg. They helped the rabbit to get out
of the thicket, and then all talked together and
laughed and sang until the woods echoed with
the noise. Next story will tell of an adventure
with Sneaky and Mr. Fox.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STORY XIV<br />

<small><span class="smcap">An Adventure With Sneaky and Mr. Fox</span></small></h2></div>


<p>As the end of the two days of truce declared
by the animals in the woods drew near,
Bumper was pleased to find that all of his
friends had new homes and were contentedly
settled in them. Pink Nose, Rolly Polly,
Crooked Ears and Brindley the Lame had
found burrows carefully hidden in the heart
of the forest for their families. Mr. Beaver
had constructed a new dam and a run-way
from it to a house in the middle of the stream.
Billy the Mink and Browny the Muskrat had
burrowed under the river&#8217;s embankment a
most elaborate system of tunnels for their hiding
places.</p>

<p>The birds had likewise found nests for their
little ones, some swinging from the top
branches of tall trees, and others hidden under
the leaves on the ground. White Tail the
Deer had retired to a lonely part of the forest
for his home; Bobby Gray Squirrel and Stripe
the Chipmunk had made their nests in secret
holes in the trees. Even Spotty the Chameleon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
was settled, and Lazy the Snail was safe
in the mud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything&#8217;s all right now&mdash;just as it was
before the fire,&#8221; remarked Bumper as he
hopped through the woods toward his own
burrow, after making a round of the woods to
see if any of his friends were still homeless.
He had made so many friends now that it
took him a long time to visit them in turn, and
he was very tired.</p>

<p>When he came to a wide clearing stretching
across his path, he stopped at the edge to look
around. He had never been there before, and
he was a little cautious. It might be a trap set
for him by the Hunters, and he sniffed the air
to see if the Hounds were near.</p>

<p>Then he hopped across it until he came to a
deep hole or pit in the middle. He wondered
what this was for, and stopped at the brink of
it to look down. It was a bare, empty pit,
with no sign of a trap near it.</p>

<p>Suddenly from behind there came a rush of
small feet, and Mr. Fox shouted aloud, &#8220;Now
I&#8217;ve got you, Bumper!&#8221;</p>

<p>So swiftly had Mr. Fox jumped out of the
bushes that Bumper had merely a second to
think. He couldn&#8217;t retreat, for Mr. Fox was
immediately behind him. There seemed to be
only one thing to do. He took a flying leap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
across the pit, hoping to reach the other side
in safety.</p>

<p>But it was a wide pit. No rabbit could hop
across it. Bumper would never have tried it
if he hadn&#8217;t been excited. He missed the other
side by a yard, and tumbled straight into the
pit. He landed on the bottom with a thump,
and then looked up. Mr. Fox was grinning
down at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d do that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s
why I waited until you were looking in the
pit. Your curiosity will cost you dearly,
Bumper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Mr. Fox, the truce isn&#8217;t up yet,&#8221;
pleaded Bumper. &#8220;Surely you won&#8217;t break
your word of honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; grinned the Fox, &#8220;I won&#8217;t break my
word, but I&#8217;ll keep you here until morning,
and then breakfast off you. That wouldn&#8217;t be
breaking my word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t intend to stay in here until morning,&#8221;
replied Bumper.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;ll you get out?&#8221; laughed the Fox.</p>

<p>Bumper tried jumping up the side of the
pit, but every time he failed Mr. Fox rolled
over and laughed. He couldn&#8217;t jump up the
sides any more than he could leap across the
pit, and Mr. Fox knew it.</p>

<p>But in one corner Bumper spied a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
hole which the water had made in the soft
earth. The pit was drained through this hole,
and Bumper immediately saw a way of
escape.</p>

<p>What he should have done was to race for
the hole the moment he discovered it, but he
hesitated until Mr. Fox&#8217;s keen eyes saw it too.
With a snarl of rage, the Fox reared on his
hind feet, and when Bumper started for the
mouth of the hole he leaped into the pit. He
reached the corner first, and blocked the hole.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho! Ho!&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;You thought
you&#8217;d get out that way. Well, I&#8217;m going to
watch at this hole until morning. Then I&#8217;ll
catch you and eat you for breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper retreated to the other side of the
pit. He looked all around for another way
out, but not finding any he squatted down in
a corner to think. Mr. Fox sat down in front
of the hole, and licked his chops. He could
afford to keep his word and not attack Bumper
until the two days were up, for Bumper was
a prisoner.</p>

<p>But pretty soon along came Sneaky the
Wolf. He sniffed around and smelling Mr.
Fox came and looked down the pit. &#8220;Good
morning, Mr. Fox,&#8221; he said politely. &#8220;What
are you doing down there?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the sight of Sneaky alarmed the Fox.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
He dreaded the Wolf as much as Bumper
feared the Fox. He had an unpleasant idea
that he would have great difficulty in getting
out of the pit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was taking a nap, Mr. Wolf,&#8221; he replied
in a trembling voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I think I&#8217;ll come down and take one
with you, Mr. Fox.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, please don&#8217;t,&#8221; pleaded Mr. Fox.
&#8220;You know the truce isn&#8217;t up yet, Sneaky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but it will be in the morning. I can
afford to wait until then for my breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that Sneaky leaped down into the
pit. He trotted around, grinning and nodding
his head. &#8220;What&#8217;s behind you, Mr. Fox?&#8221; he
asked, coming closer. &#8220;Oh, a hole! You
thought you could escape through that. If
you don&#8217;t mind I&#8217;ll watch there until morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Fox took the hint, and jumped away.
He ran around the pit, and made a few desperate
efforts to leap out of it, but he couldn&#8217;t
more than reach three-quarters of the way up.
Bumper watched him in silence, and Sneaky
grinned at every failure, and shouted with
glee:</p>

<p>&#8220;Try it again, Mr. Fox! If you don&#8217;t succeed
at first, try, try again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The jeering of Sneaky alarmed Mr. Fox so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
that he tried again and again to scramble out
of the pit. Then he sneaked off in a corner to
think.</p>

<p>Right then, when Sneaky was so sure of his
morning&#8217;s breakfast, Loup the Lynx came
along. One glance down the pit brought a
horrid grin to his ugly face. His eyes glowed,
and his tail lashed with delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Ha!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;How&#8217;d you get
down there, Sneaky?&#8221; he called. &#8220;Fell in,
and can&#8217;t get out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; replied Sneaky boldly, as his
heart beat rapidly. &#8220;I can leap out any time
I want to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see you do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you, I&#8217;m satisfied where I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; added Loup, &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll
come down and keep you company until morning.
I&#8217;m going to be very hungry then. I&#8217;ve
fasted for two days now.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Loup the Lynx dropped into the pit.
Sneaky made a desperate effort to leap out,
but he too failed. What Bumper and Mr. Fox
failed in doing was beyond his reach. He fell
back repeatedly, while Loup doubled up with
glee and laughed until the forest rang with
echoes of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t do it, Sneaky,&#8221; he shouted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
&#8220;And in the morning I&#8217;ll have a fine breakfast
A pleasant night to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sneaky ran away and sat down in a corner
to think, while Loup closed one eye in sleep,
but kept the other wide open. What happened
to them in the pit will follow in the
next story.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STORY XV<br />

<small><span class="smcap">What Happened at the Bottom of the Pit</span></small></h2></div>


<p>Meanwhile Bumper had been crouching in
his corner, partly hidden from view by a few
leaves blown into the pit by the wind.
Neither Sneaky nor Loup had seen him, and
Mr. Fox was so troubled by the presence of
his two enemies in the pit that he gave scant
attention to the white rabbit. He had no
stomach now for breakfast or dinner. His
one desire was to get away safely before
morning.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Bumper, Loup had taken
up his watchful position directly in front of
the small hole. If he would only move a
little to one side, the white rabbit could
escape. While the hole was too small for Mr.
Fox or Sneaky to squeeze through, Bumper
could easily get in it.</p>

<p>All night long Bumper kept a watchful eye
on Loup and the mouth of the hole. Once
the Lynx got up and yawned, stretching his
great, powerful legs, but he didn&#8217;t change his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
place. The moon came out, partly flooding
the pit with its bright light. Bumper crouched
in the shadows and waited.</p>

<p>Mr. Fox and Sneaky were so quiet that
Loup grew suspicious. He raised his head
and glared around him. One side of the pit
was in dark shadow, and he crept toward it to
see if all was well with his victim.</p>

<p>This was Bumper&#8217;s opportunity. Quick as
a flash he darted across the pit. In the moonlight
his white coat was hardly visible. It
was not until Loup heard the crunch of his
feet on the sand that the Lynx was aware of
his presence. Then he made a dive for him,
but Bumper scooted into the hole and escaped.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;d known that rabbit was down here,&#8221;
growled Loup, &#8220;I&#8217;d kept watch at that hole.&#8221;
Then grinning wickedly, he added: &#8220;But a
rabbit or two doesn&#8217;t make much difference so
long as I have you, Sneaky.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sneaky the Wolf made no reply, but sulked
in his corner. He was debating in his mind
whether it wouldn&#8217;t be better to attack Mr.
Fox, and offer him as a peace offering. Perhaps
Loup would be satisfied with that, and
then let him go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Loup,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Mr. Fox is down here,
too. Now if you&#8217;ll promise to let me go, I&#8217;ll
catch him and give him to you for breakfast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
He&#8217;s much tenderer and fatter than I, and
I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Ha! So Mr. Fox is down here, is
he?&#8221; said Loup, licking his jaws. &#8220;Then my
breakfast and dinner&#8217;s all prepared for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if you don&#8217;t let me go,&#8221; whined
Sneaky, &#8220;I&#8217;ll help Mr. Fox to get away.&#8221;</p>

<p>This threat amused Loup, and he rolled
over and over with laughter. &#8220;How would
you help him, Sneaky?&#8221; he asked finally. &#8220;The
two of you together couldn&#8217;t get out of this
pit. No, no, you&#8217;re prisoners, and I&#8217;m doing
you both a favor by eating you. If I didn&#8217;t
you&#8217;d die down here from slow starvation.
Now you see how good I am to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you can&#8217;t jump out either,&#8221; replied
Sneaky. &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t believe you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a joke!&#8221; laughed Loup. &#8220;Just to
show you, I&#8217;ll jump out, and then back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>He crouched for the spring, the great
muscles of his hind legs knotting in big lumps.
Then his body shot upward like a stone released
from a spring trap. But he didn&#8217;t
reach the top. Oh, no, not by a couple of
yards! He clawed and scratched at the sides
of the pit, but the loose sand rolled down the
side and carried him with it. Dumbfounded
and angered by this mishap, he made another
spring, but again he fell short.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>Six times Loup tried it, and failed. Then
he trotted around and tried it on the opposite
side of the pit. But he failed just as the others
had. He couldn&#8217;t leap out of the pit, try
as he would.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did I tell you, Loup,&#8221; exclaimed
Sneaky triumphantly. &#8220;We&#8217;re all prisoners
down here, and instead of fighting each other
we should try to think of some way of escape.
Three minds are better than one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can you suggest, Sneaky?&#8221; asked
Loup, whose defiant spirit was considerably
tamed now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t know. Perhaps if I could
stand on your back, and Mr. Fox on mine, one
of us could get out. Mr. Fox surely could,
and then he could throw down something to
help us out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t trust you,&#8221; growled Loup.
&#8220;Neither would I trust Mr. Fox. He&#8217;d run
away, and leave us here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I wouldn&#8217;t, Loup,&#8221; replied Mr.
Fox.</p>

<p>Loup considered. No, he wouldn&#8217;t trust
either of them. Neither would Sneaky or Mr.
Fox trust him. Just because each had a bad
reputation for deceit, neither dared help the
other to get out. It is generally so with those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
who lie and deceive. There is little honor
among thieves.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bumper had scurried through
the hole, and found his way out under the
river&#8217;s embankment. The water from the pit
drained through to the river, and this accounted
for the long tunnel.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, how thankful I am to get out with a
whole skin!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;It was a narrow
escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>He cleaned the dirt from his white fur, and
glanced up happily at the moon. &#8220;It will go
hard with Mr. Fox and Sneaky,&#8221; he added.
&#8220;I suppose Loup will kill both of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shuddered at the very thought, and
hopped along in silence. In a short time he
stopped again. He couldn&#8217;t get out of his
mind the thought of Mr. Fox&#8217;s fate and of
Sneaky&#8217;s. After all they would suffer just as
much in being killed as he would. Of course,
in a way they deserved it, for they intended to
kill him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still, I can&#8217;t bear to think of them suffering
so,&#8221; he reflected, &#8220;not even if they did
intend to eat me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper was very tender hearted, and the
more he thought of the terrible fate of his two
enemies the less he liked it. Finally, he sat
upright, and said: &#8220;I must see Buster the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Bear. Maybe he can do something to help
Mr. Fox and Sneaky. Anyway I must tell
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>After that he hopped along more rapidly,
and long before morning he found Buster&#8217;s
den and knocked on the door. Buster wasn&#8217;t
very pleased at being roused out of his sleep
in the middle of the night, and he grumbled
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want, Bumper? If it isn&#8217;t
anything important go away, and let me finish
my nap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is important, Buster, or I shouldn&#8217;t disturb
you,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>Bumper told him the story of his adventures,
which pleased Buster, who soon lost all
desire for sleep. Before Bumper was through
he was chuckling.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you say Loup, and Sneaky and Mr.
Fox are in the pit now, and can&#8217;t get out?&#8221;
he queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Buster, and I wish you could help
Mr. Fox and Sneaky. They&#8217;ll be eaten up
by Loup in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! Ha!&#8221; laughed Buster. &#8220;I must get
around early to see the circus. It will surely
be worth seeing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But aren&#8217;t you going to help Mr. Fox or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Sneaky?&#8221; asked Bumper. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I
called to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Help them?&#8221; grunted Buster. &#8220;What
for? They&#8217;ll eat you up some day if they get
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps they will,&#8221; sighed Bumper, &#8220;but
I can&#8217;t bear to think of Loup killing them
when they&#8217;re prisoners. They ought to have
a fair show.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose they should. Well,&#8221; yawning
and stretching, &#8220;we&#8217;ll see what can be
done. I&#8217;ll go with you to the pit. I&#8217;ll be
ready in a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>What they saw and did in the pit early in
the morning will be told in the next story.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">What Buster Did to Loup, Sneaky and
Mr. Fox</span></small></h2></div>


<p>Bumper and Buster reached the pit where
Loup, Sneaky and Mr. Fox were prisoners
shortly before sunrise. They had started
early, but it was some distance through the
woods. Buster crashed clumsily through the
bushes, and then crossed the clearing to the
brink of the pit. He looked down, and saw
all three prisoners at the bottom looking very
sad and dejected.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Loup!&#8221; he called. &#8220;Nice place to
spend the night! Had your breakfast yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>Loup glared back sullenly, for he knew
that Buster understood his plight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got good company down there, too,
Loup,&#8221; Buster added. &#8220;I see Sneaky and Mr.
Fox in the corner. But why so gloomy? Oh,
I see, you can&#8217;t get out! Got caught in a trap.
Well, well, that&#8217;s too bad now, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down astride a fallen tree. He enjoyed
the difficulties of the three cowed and
frightened animals.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>&#8220;Bumper here told me how Mr. Fox frightened
him and made him jump in the pit,&#8221; he
continued after a while, &#8220;and then how he
jumped in after him. Then along came
Sneaky and jumped in to eat Mr. Fox up, and
I suppose you tried to get Sneaky, Loup.
Well, well, that&#8217;s a big joke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t think so if you were down
here,&#8221; said Mr. Fox. &#8220;Oh, Buster, if you&#8217;ll
help me to get out I&#8217;ll always be your friend,
and do anything you ask of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! I couldn&#8217;t trust you, Mr. Fox.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you could, Buster! I&#8217;ll promise
on my heart that I&#8217;ll do what you ask of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster&#8217;s little eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Mr. Fox, I&#8217;ll try you. If I get
you out will you promise never to hunt the
rabbits and small animals again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Buster, I&#8217;ll do as you ask,&#8221; replied
the Fox.</p>

<p>Buster remained quiet for a moment, and
then got up and lumbered away. When he returned
he was dragging the end of a long tree.
&#8220;This is because Bumper pleaded for your
life, Mr. Fox,&#8221; he said, pushing one end of the
tree in the pit. &#8220;Now come up, and make
that promise again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Fox ran up the tree rapidly, and when
he reached the brink Buster stopped him. &#8220;On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
your heart you promise not to hunt the rabbits
and small animals any more?&#8221; the Bear
asked before he would let him pass. Once
more Mr. Fox crossed his heart and promised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then go, and if you break your word I&#8217;ll
punish you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Fox trotted away and made a break
for the thick woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Sneaky,&#8221; Buster added, &#8220;it&#8217;s your
turn. Do you want to make the same
promise?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sneaky was so anxious to get out that he was
ready to promise anything, and when he
reached the top Buster made him repeat it.
&#8220;Remember you&#8217;re on parole, Sneaky,&#8221; Buster
cautioned, &#8220;and the first time you break your
word I&#8217;ll put you in a worse place than this
pit.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Sneaky had disappeared, Buster addressed
the Lynx. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know about trusting
you Loup,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I never knew a Lynx
yet that could keep his word. However, I&#8217;ll
let you go. Give me your promise, and you
can come up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loup promised again and again that he
would let the rabbits and small animals alone.
Buster accepted his word as he had that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the others, and Loup sprang away into the
woods and disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether they&#8217;ll keep their
word, Bumper,&#8221; Buster said when they were
alone. &#8220;But at any rate they&#8217;ve had a big
scare, and fear will keep them away for a
time. I think your people will enjoy peace
for a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and all due to you, Buster,&#8221; replied
Bumper. &#8220;I&#8217;ve tried to make friends with all
the birds and animals, but Loup, Sneaky and
Mr. Fox wouldn&#8217;t meet me half way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some people are that way, Bumper.
They&#8217;re good only as long as the policeman&#8217;s
around. Hereafter I&#8217;ll be the policeman in
this woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumper nodded, for he believed that this
was true.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ve made friends with all the
other animals?&#8221; Buster asked after a while.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Beaver and Billy the Mink and
Washer the Raccoon are my friends. And so
are Gray Back the Weasel and Billy Porcupine
and Sleepy the Opossum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about me, Bumper?&#8221; grinned Buster
when he stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you&#8217;ve always been my friend,
Buster, didn&#8217;t you know it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; growled Buster, &#8220;maybe I did and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
maybe I didn&#8217;t.&#8221; Then smiling at the white
rabbit he added: &#8220;You go home now and tell
your people there&#8217;s going to be peace in the
woods hereafter. If you can agree among
yourselves, I&#8217;ll see that Loup and Sneaky and
Mr. Fox don&#8217;t bother you any more. If they
do you just tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Buster frowned so severely, and
whacked a tree with one of his huge paws so
soundly, that Bumper jumped to one side, and
then laughed at his own fear. Indeed, Buster
was one to be feared when angry, and he could
protect the small animals from their natural
enemies. One blow from those huge paws
would knock Loup senseless and crush in the
skull of Sneaky or Mr. Fox.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think now,&#8221; Bumper said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go home
and tell my people and all the animals and
birds that peace has come into the woods.
There will be no more danger for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>So his efforts to seek peace in the woods had
been rewarded. Bumper the white rabbit had
brought to his people something that was
more to be desired than the ability to fight and
protect themselves. Billy, Browny, Mr.
Beaver, Gray Back and all the other small
animals were their friends, and all feuds and
quarrels had been wiped out. There was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
be no more fighting. Each was to live his life
without constant fear of danger.</p>

<p>Can you wonder that Bumper was light-hearted
and full of gladness? When he met
Rusty the Blackbird, he had to stop and tell
him the good news, and Rusty immediately
flew away to spread it among all the birds.</p>

<p>By the time Bumper reached home, the
birds were gathered there to welcome him,
and to listen to his story. Then came trooping
through the woods shortly after Pink Nose,
Crooked Ears, Brindley the Lame and Rolly
Polly, with all their families. It was a great
gathering of rabbits and birds. And they
made such a noise that Billy Porcupine hurried
out of his hole to find out what it was all
about, and Gray Back the Weasel and Browny
the Muskrat came, and Sleepy the Opossum,
and Washer the Raccoon and Mr. Beaver and
Groundy the Woodchuck. Everybody of importance
seemed to be there. They talked and
listened, and feasted and danced, until night
time, and when they finally crept away to their
burrows and nests they vowed they would
never quarrel or fight among themselves
again. Bumper had taught them to live in
peace and happiness, and they would follow
his example.</p>







<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>But of course they had many adventures
after that&mdash;all of them&mdash;and particularly

saved from the fire, and if you want to hear
what great things happened to him you

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once an old woman who had so
many rabbits that she hardly knew what to do.
They ate her out of house and home, and kept
the cupboard so bare she often had to go to bed
hungry. But none of the rabbits suffered this
way. They all had their supper, and their breakfast,
too, even if there wasn&#8217;t a crust left in the
old woman&#8217;s cupboard.</p>

<p>There were big rabbits and little rabbits; lean
ones and fat ones; comical little youngsters who
played pranks upon their elders, and staid, serious
old ones who never laughed or smiled the

mother rabbits and father rabbits, and goodness

They all lived under one big roof in the</p>

<small><span class="smcap">White Tail&#8217;s First Lesson</span></small></h2></div>


<p>High among the timberland of the North
Woods White Tail the Deer was born, and if
you had stumbled upon his home in the thickets
you would have been surprised by a noise
like the rushing of the wind, and then by a
very remarkable silence that could almost be
felt. The first was made by Mother White
Tail as she deserted her young and took to
quick flight.</p>

<p>White Tail, crouching low down in the
bushes, so still that he scarcely moved a hair,
would hide his beautiful head in the branches
and leaves like an obedient child. Left alone
he knew that his one chance of escape was not
to move or whimper or cry.</p>

<p>That was the first lesson White Tail was
taught by his mother&mdash;to keep absolutely
quiet in the presence of danger. When he
was so small that he could hardly hold up his
head, she whispered to him: &#8220;Listen, White
Tail! When I give the signal that the hunters
are coming, you must flatten yourself down</p>

<small><span class="smcap">White Tail Jumps Stepping Stone Brook</span></small></h2></div>


<p>White Tail grew rapidly in size and
strength, his long, clean limbs showing taut
muscles and great springing power; and his
neck grew thick and short, which is well for a
buck, who must use it in savage thrusts when
the head is a battering ram. His horns were
short and bony, but they protruded in front
like knobs against which it would be unpleasant
to fall.</p>

<p>But his antlers were his pride. They spread
out fan-shape on his head, crowning it with
a glory that made Mother Deer supremely
happy. At times it seemed as if the antlers
were too heavy for the head and neck, but
White Tail carried them easily, and when he
shook them in sport or anger any one could
see they were just fitted to him.</p>

<p>In time he stood as high as Father Buck,
and a head taller than Mother Deer. The
day the tip of his antlers reached an inch above
Father Buck&#8217;s, he felt a little thrill of pride.</p>

<p>Washer was the youngest of a family of
three Raccoons, born in the woods close to
the shores of Beaver Pond, and not half a mile
from Rocky Falls where the water, as you
know, turns into silvery spray that sparkles
in the sun-shine like diamonds and rubies.
And, indeed, the animals and birds of the
North Woods much prefer this glittering
spray and foam that rise in a steady cloud
from the bottom of the falls to all the jewels
and gems ever dug out of the earth! For,
though each drop sparkles but a moment, and
then vanishes from sight, there are a million
others to follow it, and when you bathe in
them they wash and scour away the dirt, and
make you clean and fresh in body and soul.</p>

<p>Washer had his first great adventure at
Rocky Falls, and it is a wonder that he ever
lived to tell the tale, for the water which
flows over the falls is almost as cruel and terrible
as it is sparkling and inviting. But</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
